<h1>Visual formatting model</h1> <p><span class="seoSummary">The CSS <em>visual formatting model</em> is an algorithm that processes a document and displays it on visual media.</span> This model is a basic concept of CSS. The visual formatting model transforms each element of the document and generates zero, one, or several boxes that conform to the CSS box model. The layout of each box is defined by:</p> <ul> <li>The dimensions of the box: precisely defined or constrained, or not</li> <li>The type of box: inline, inline-level, atomic inline-level, block</li> <li>The <a title="CSS/Box positioning scheme" href="../box_positioning_scheme/">positioning scheme</a>: in the normal flow, a float, or absolute positioning</li> <li>The other elements in the tree: its children and neighbors</li> <li>The <a title="viewport: A viewport represents a polygonal (normally rectangular) area in computer graphics that is currently being viewed. In web browser terms, it refers to the part of the browser that is taken up by visible website content." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/viewport" class="glossaryLink" target="_blank">viewport</a> size and position</li> <li>Intrinsic dimensions of contained images</li> <li>Other external information</li> </ul> <p>The model renders a box in relation to the edge of its <em>containing block</em>. Usually, a box establishes the containing block for its descendants. However, a box is not constrained by its containing block; when a box's layout goes outside the containing block, it is said to <em>overflow</em>.</p> <h2 id="Box_generation">Box generation</h2> <p>Box generation is the part of the CSS visual formatting model that creates boxes from the document's elements. Generated boxes are of different types, which affect how the visual formatting is done. The type of the box generated depends of the value of the <a title="The display CSS property specifies the type of rendering box used for an element. In HTML, default display property values are taken from behaviors described in the HTML specifications or from the browser/user default stylesheet. The default value in XML is inline." href="../display/"><code>display</code></a> CSS property.</p> <h3 id="Block-level_elements_and_block_boxes">Block-level elements and block boxes</h3> <p>An element is said to be <em>block-level</em> when the calculated value of its <a title="The display CSS property specifies the type of rendering box used for an element. In HTML, default display property values are taken from behaviors described in the HTML specifications or from the browser/user default stylesheet. The default value in XML is inline." href="../display/"><code>display</code></a> CSS property is: <code>block</code>, <code>list-item</code> or <code>table</code>. A block-level element is visually formatted as a block (e.g., paragraph), intended to be vertically stacked.</p> <p>Each block-level box participates in a <a title="block formatting context" href="../block_formatting_context/">block formatting context</a>. Each block-level element generates at least one block-level box, called the <em>principal block-level</em><em> box</em>. Some elements, like a list-item element generating further boxes to handle bullets and other typographic elements introducing the list item, may generate more boxes, but most generate only the principal block-level box.</p> <p>The principal block-level box contains descendant-generated boxes and generated content. It is also the box involved in the <a title="CSS/Positioning scheme" href="../positioning_scheme/">positioning scheme</a>.</p> <p><img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/@api/deki/files/5995/=venn_blocks.png" alt="venn_blocks.png" style="float: left;;float: none; display: block;" class="internal lwrap">A block-level box may also be a block container box. A <em>block container box</em> is a box that contains only other block-level boxes, or creates an <a title="CSS/Inline formatting context" href="../inline_formatting_context/">inline formatting context</a>, and thus contains only inline boxes. It is important to note that the notions of a block-level box and block container box are disjoined. The first describes how the box behaves with its parents and sibling, the second how it interacts with its descendants. Some block-level boxes, like tables, aren't block container boxes and, reciprocally, some block container boxes, like non-replaced inline blocks and non-replaced table cells, aren't block-level boxes.</p> <p>Block-level boxes that also are block container boxes are called <em>block boxes</em>.</p> <h4 id="Anonymous_block_boxes">Anonymous block boxes</h4> <p>In some cases, the visual formatting algorithm needs to add supplementary boxes. Because CSS selectors cannot style or name these boxes, they are called <em>anonymous boxes</em>.</p> <p>Because selectors do not work with anonymous boxes, they cannot be styled via a stylesheet. It means that all inheritable CSS properties have the <code>inherit</code> value, and all non-inheritable CSS properties, have the <code>initial</code> value.</p> <p>Block containing boxes contain only inline-level boxes or only block-level boxes. But often the document contains a mix of both. In that case, anonymous block boxes are created around adjacent inline-level boxes.</p> <div class="note">If we take the following HTML code (with default styling applied to it, that is <a title="The HTML &lt;div&gt; element is the generic container for flow content and does not inherently represent anything. Use it to group elements for purposes such as styling (using the class or id attributes), marking a section of a document in a different language (using the lang attribute), and so on." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div" target="_blank"><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></a> and <a title="The HTML &lt;p&gt; element represents a paragraph of text." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p" target="_blank"><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></a> elements have <code>display:block</code> :<br> <br> <code>&lt;div&gt;Some inline text &lt;p&gt;followed by a paragraph&lt;/p&gt; followed by more inline text.&lt;/div&gt;</code><br> <br> two anonymous block boxes are created, one for the text before the paragraph (<code>Some inline text</code>) and one for the text after it (<code>followed by more inline text</code>), which gives the following block structure:<br> <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/@api/deki/files/5996/=anonymous_block-level_boxes.png" alt="anonymous_block-level_boxes.png" class="default internal"></p> <p>which leads to:</p> <pre>Some inline text
followed by a paragraph
followed by more inline text.
</pre> <p>Unlike the <a title="The HTML &lt;p&gt; element represents a paragraph of text." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p" target="_blank"><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></a> element's box, the web developers cannot control the style of the two anonymous boxes. Inheritable properties take the value from the <a title="The HTML &lt;div&gt; element is the generic container for flow content and does not inherently represent anything. Use it to group elements for purposes such as styling (using the class or id attributes), marking a section of a document in a different language (using the lang attribute), and so on." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div" target="_blank"><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></a>'s property value, like <a title="The color property sets the foreground color of an element's text content, and its decorations. It doesn't affect any other characteristic of the element; it should really be called text-color and would have been named so, save for historical reasons and its appearance in CSS Level 1." href="../color/"><code>color</code></a> to define the color of the text, and set the others to the <code>initial</code> value. For example, they won't have a specific <a title="The background-color CSS property sets the background color of an element, either through a color value or the keyword transparent." href="../background-color/"><code>background-color</code></a>, it is always transparent, the<code> initial</code> value for that property, and thus the background of the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is visible. In the opposite, a specific background color can be applied to the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> box. Similarly, the two anonymous boxes always use the same color for their text.</p> </div> <p>Another case that leads to the creation of anonymous block boxes is an inline box that contains one or several block boxes. In that case, the box containing the block box is split into two inline boxes - one before and one after the block box. All the inline boxes before the block box are then enclosed into an <em>anonymous block box</em>, so are the inline boxes following the block box. Therefore, the block box becomes the sibling of the two anonymous block boxes containing the inline elements.</p> <p>If there are several block boxes, without inline content in-between, the anonymous block boxes are created before and after the set of boxes.</p> <div class="note"> <p>If we take the following HTML code, with <a title="The HTML &lt;p&gt; element represents a paragraph of text." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p" target="_blank"><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></a> have <code>display:inline</code> and <a title="The HTML &lt;span&gt; element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span" target="_blank"><code>&lt;span&gt;</code></a> have <code>display:block</code> :<br> <br> <code>&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;em&gt;inline&lt;/em&gt; text &lt;span&gt;followed by a paragraph&lt;/span&gt; followed by more inline text.&lt;/p&gt;</code><br> <br> two anonymous block boxes are created, one for the text before the span Element (<code>Some <em>inline</em> text</code>) and one for the text after it (<code>followed by more inline text</code>), which gives the following block structure:</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13625/anonymous_block_box_break.png" alt="" style="height: 137px; width: 597px;"></p> <p>which leads to:</p> <pre>Some inline text
followed by a paragraph
followed by more inline text.
</pre> </div> <h3 id="Inline-level_elements_and_inline_boxes">Inline-level elements and inline boxes</h3> <p>An element is said to be <em>inline-level</em> when the calculated value of its <a title="The display CSS property specifies the type of rendering box used for an element. In HTML, default display property values are taken from behaviors described in the HTML specifications or from the browser/user default stylesheet. The default value in XML is inline." href="../display/"><code>display</code></a> CSS property is: <code>inline</code>, <code>inline-block</code> or <code>inline-table</code>. Visually, it doesn't constitute blocks of contents but is distributed in lines with other inline-level content. Typically, the content of a paragraph, with different formattings like emphasis or images, is made from inline-level elements.</p> <p><img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/@api/deki/files/6008/=venn_inlines.png" alt="venn_inlines.png" style="float: left;;float: none; display: block;" class="internal lwrap"></p> <div class="warning"> <p>This diagram uses outdated terminology; see note below. Besides that, it is incorrect because the yellow ellipsis on the right side is per definition either identical to the one on the left side, or bigger than that (it could be a mathematical superset), because the spec says "Inline-level elements generate inline-level boxes, which are boxes that participate in an inline formatting context", see CSS 2.2, chapter 9.2.2</p> </div> <p>Inline-level elements generate <em>inline-level boxes</em> that are defined as boxes participating to an <a title="CSS/Inline formatting context" href="../inline_formatting_context/">inline formatting context</a>. <em>Inline boxes</em> are both inline-level boxes and boxes whose contents participate in their container's inline formatting context. This is the case for example for all non-replaced boxes with <code>display:inline</code>. Inline-level boxes whose contents do not participate in an inline formatting context are called <em>atomic inline-level boxes</em>. These boxes, generated by replaced inline-level elements or by elements with a calculated <a title="The display CSS property specifies the type of rendering box used for an element. In HTML, default display property values are taken from behaviors described in the HTML specifications or from the browser/user default stylesheet. The default value in XML is inline." href="../display/"><code>display</code></a> value of <code>inline-block</code> or <code>inline-table</code>, are never split into several boxes, as is possible with inline boxes.</p> <div class="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> Initially, atomic inline-level boxes were called atomic inline boxes. This was rather unfortunate as they are not inline boxes. This was corrected in an erratum to the spec. Nevertheless, you can harmlessly read atomic inline-level box each time you meet atomic inline box in the literature as this only is a name change.</div> <div class="note">Atomic inline boxes cannot be split into several lines in an inline formatting context. <div style="-moz-column-width: 30em;"> <pre>&lt;style&gt;
  span {
    display:inline; /* default value*/
  }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div style="width:20em;"&gt;
   The text in the span &lt;span&gt;can be split in several
   lines as it&lt;/span&gt; is an inline box.
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre> <p>which leads to:</p> <div style="width: 20em;">The text in the span <span>can be split into several lines as it</span> is an inline box.</div> <pre>&lt;style&gt;
  span {
    display:inline-block;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div style="width:20em;"&gt;
   The text in the span &lt;span&gt;cannot be split in several
   lines as it&lt;/span&gt; is an inline-block box.
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre> <p>which leads to:</p> <div style="width: 20em;">The text in the span <span style="display: inline-block;">cannot be split into several lines as it</span> is an inline-block box.</div> </div> </div> <h4 id="Anonymous_inline_boxes">Anonymous inline boxes</h4> <p>As for block boxes, there are a few cases where inline boxes are created automatically by the CSS engine. These inline boxes are also anonymous as they cannot be named by selectors; they inherit the value of all inheritable properties and set it to <code>initial</code> for all others.</p> <p>The most common case where an anonymous inline box is created is when some text is found as a direct child of a block box creating an inline formatting context. In that case, this text is included in the largest possible anonymous inline box. Also, space content that would finally be removed by the behavior set by the <a title="The white-space property is used to describe how whitespace inside the element is handled." href="../white-space/"><code>white-space</code></a> CSS property does not generate anonymous inline boxes because they would end empty.</p> <div class="note">Example TBD</div> <h3 id="Other_types_of_boxes">Other types of boxes</h3> <h4 id="Line_boxes">Line boxes</h4> <p><em>Line boxes</em> are generated by the <a title="block formatting context" href="../inline_formatting_context/">inline formatting context</a> to represent a line of text. Inside a block box, a line box extends from one border of the box to the other. When there are <a title="float" href="../float/">floats</a>, the line box starts at the rightmost border of the left floats and ends at the leftmost border of the right floats.</p> <p>These boxes are technical, and web authors usually do not have to bother with them.</p> <h4 id="Run-in_boxes">Run-in boxes</h4> <p><em>Run-in boxes</em>, defined using <code>display:run-in</code>, are boxes that are either block boxes or inline boxes, depending on the type of the following box. They can be used to create a title that runs inside its first paragraph when possible.</p> <div class="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> Run-in boxes were removed from the CSS 2.1 standard, as they were insufficiently specified to allow for interoperable implementation. They may reappear in CSS3, but meanwhile are considered <em>experimental</em>. They should not be used in production.</div> <h4 id="Model-induced_boxes" class="note">Model-induced boxes</h4> <p>Besides the inline and block formatting contexts, CSS specifies several additional <em>content models</em> that may be applied to elements. These additional models, used to describe specific layouts, may define additional box types:</p> <ul> <li>The <a title="table-layout" href="../table-layout/">table content model</a> may create a <em>table wrapper box</em> and a <em>table box</em>, but also specific boxes like <em>caption boxes</em>.</li> <li>The <a title="Using CSS multi-column layouts" href="../using_css_multi-column_layouts/">multi-column content model</a> may create <em>column boxes</em> between the container box and the content<em>.</em>
</li> <li>The experimental grid or flex-box content models also create additional types of boxes.</li> </ul> <h2 id="Positioning_schemes" class="note">Positioning schemes</h2> <p>Once boxes are generated, the CSS engine needs to position them on the layout. To do that, it uses one of the following algorithms:</p> <ul> <li>The <em>normal flow</em> positions each box one after the other.</li> <li>The <em>floats</em> algorithm extracts the box from the normal flow and put it to the side of the containing box.</li> <li>The <em>absolute positioning</em> scheme positions a box within an absolute coordinate system that is established by its containing element. An absolutely positioned element can cover other elements.</li> </ul> <h3 id="Normal_flow">Normal flow</h3> <p>In the <em>normal flow</em>, boxes are laid out one after the other. In a block formatting context, they are laid out vertically; in an inline formatting context, they are laid out horizontally. The normal flow is triggered when the CSS <a title="The position CSS property chooses alternative rules for positioning elements, designed to be useful for scripted animation effects." href="../position/"><code>position</code></a> is set to the value <code>static</code> or <code>relative</code>, and if the CSS <a title="The float CSS property specifies that an element should be taken from the normal flow and placed along the left or right side of its container, where text and inline elements will wrap around it." href="../float/"><code>float</code></a> is set to the value <code>none</code>.</p> <div class="note">When in the normal flow, in a block formatting context, boxes are laid vertically one after the other out:<br> <br> [image]<br> <br> When in the normal flow, in an inline formatting context, boxes are laid horizontally one after the other out:<br> <br> [image]</div> <p class="note">There are two sub-cases of the normal flow: static positioning and relative positioning:</p> <ul> <li class="note">In <em>static positioning</em>, triggered by the value <code>static</code> of the <a title="The position CSS property chooses alternative rules for positioning elements, designed to be useful for scripted animation effects." href="../position/"><code>position</code></a> property, the boxes are drawn at the exact position defined by the normal flow layout.<br> [image]</li> <li class="note">In <em>relative</em><em> positioning</em>, triggered by the value <code>relative</code> of the <a title="The position CSS property chooses alternative rules for positioning elements, designed to be useful for scripted animation effects." href="../position/"><code>position</code></a> property, the boxes are drawn with an offset defined by the <a title="The top CSS property specifies part of the position of positioned elements.

This leads to the property that text (and more generally anything within the normal flow) flows along the edge of the floating boxes, except if told differently by the <a title="The clear CSS property specifies whether an element can be next to floating elements that precede it or must be moved down (cleared) below them. The clear property applies to both floating and non-floating elements." href="../clear/"><code>clear</code></a> CSS property.</p> <p>The float positioning scheme for a box is selected by setting the <a title="The float CSS property specifies that an element should be taken from the normal flow and placed along the left or right side of its container, where text and inline elements will wrap around it." href="../float/"><code>float</code></a> CSS property on that box to a value different than <code>none</code> and <a title="The position CSS property chooses alternative rules for positioning elements, designed to be useful for scripted animation effects." href="../position/"><code>position</code></a> to <code>static</code> or <code>relative</code>. If <a title="The float CSS property specifies that an element should be taken from the normal flow and placed along the left or right side of its container, where text and inline elements will wrap around it." href="../float/"><code>float</code></a> is set to <code>left</code>, the float is positioned at the beginning of the line box; if set to <code>right</code>, the float is positioned at the end of the line box. In either case, the line box is shrunk to fit alongside the float.</p> <p>[image]</p> <h3 id="Absolute_positioning">Absolute positioning</h3> <p>In the <em>absolute positioning scheme</em>, boxes are entirely removed from the flow and don't interact with it at all. They are positioned relative to their <a title="CSS/Containing block" href="../containing_block/">containing block</a> using the <a title="The top CSS property specifies part of the position of positioned elements. It has no effect on non-positioned elements." href="../top/"><code>top</code></a>, <a title="The bottom CSS property participates in specifying the position of positioned elements." href="../bottom/"><code>bottom</code></a>, <a title="The left CSS property specifies part of the position of positioned elements." href="../left/"><code>left</code></a> and <a title="The right CSS property specifies part of the position of positioned elements." href="../right/"><code>right</code></a> CSS properties.</p> <p>An element is absolutely positioned if the <a title="The position CSS property chooses alternative rules for positioning elements, designed to be useful for scripted animation effects." href="../position/"><code>position</code></a> is set to <code>absolute</code> or <code>fixed</code>.</p> <p>With a <em>fixed positioned element</em>, the containing block is the viewport.
