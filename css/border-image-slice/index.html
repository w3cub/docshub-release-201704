<h1>border-image-slice</h1>  <p>The <strong><code>border-image-slice</code></strong> CSS property divides the image specified by <a title="The border-image-source CSS property defines the &lt;image&gt; to use instead of the style of the border. If this property is set to none, the style defined by border-style is used instead." href="../border-image-source/"><code>border-image-source</code></a> in nine regions: the four corners, the four edges and the middle. It does this by specifying 4 inwards offsets.</p> <p><a style="float: left;" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/files/3814/border-image-slice.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/files/3814/border-image-slice.png" style="height: 132px; margin: 1px; padding: 1em; width: 250px;" alt="The nine slices defined by the CSS border-image shorthand or border-image-slice longhand properties"></a>Four values control the position of the slice lines. If some are not specified, they are inferred from the other with the usual 4-value syntax of CSS.</p> <p>The middle is not used by the border itself but is used as a background-image if the keyword <code>fill</code> is set. The keyword can be set at any position in the property (before, after or between the other values).</p> <p>The <a title="The border-image-repeat CSS property defines how the middle part of a border image is handled so that it can match the size of the border. It has a one-value syntax that describes the behavior of all the sides, and a two-value syntax that sets a different value for the horizontal and vertical behavior." href="../border-image-repeat/"><code>border-image-repeat</code></a>, <a title="The border-image-width CSS property defines the width of the border image by defining inward offsets from the border edges. If the border-image-width is greater than the border-width, then the border image extends beyond the padding (and/or content) edge." href="../border-image-width/"><code>border-image-width</code></a>, <a title="The border-image-outset property describes by what amount the border image area extends beyond the border box." href="../border-image-outset/"><code>border-image-outset</code></a> properties define how these images will be used.</p> <p>The shorthand CSS property <a title="The border-image CSS property allows drawing an image on the borders of elements. This makes drawing complex looking widgets much simpler than it has been and removes the need for nine boxes in some cases. The border-image is used instead of the border styles given by the border-style properties.
