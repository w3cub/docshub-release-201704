<h1>linear-gradient()</h1> <p>The CSS <code>linear-gradient()</code> function creates an <a title="The &lt;image&gt; CSS data type represents a 2D image. There are two kinds of images in CSS: plain static images, often referenced using a URL, and dynamically-generated images like gradients or representations of parts of the tree." href="../image/"><code>&lt;image&gt;</code></a> which represents a linear gradient of colors. The result of this function is an object of the CSS <a title="The &lt;gradient&gt; CSS data type denotes a CSS &lt;image&gt; made of a progressive transition between two or more colors. A CSS gradient is not a CSS &lt;color&gt; but an image with no intrinsic dimensions; that is, it has no natural or preferred size, nor a preferred ratio. Its concrete size will match the one of the element it applies to." href="../gradient/"><code>&lt;gradient&gt;</code></a> data type. Like any other gradient, a CSS linear gradient is not a CSS <a title="The &lt;color&gt; CSS data type denotes a color in the sRGB color space. A color can be described in any of these ways:" href="../color_value/"><code>&lt;color&gt;</code></a> but an image with <a href="../image/#no_intrinsic">no intrinsic dimensions</a>; that is, it has neither natural or preferred size, nor ratio. Its concrete size will match the size of the element it applies to.</p> <p>Linear gradients are defined by an axis, the <em>gradient line</em>, with each point on it being of a different color. Perpendicular lines to the gradient-line have one single color, the one of the point on the gradient line.</p> <p><img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/files/3537/linear-gradient.png" alt="linear-gradient.png" style="float: left; height: 383px; width: 309px;;float: none; display: block;"></p> <p>The gradient line is defined by the center of the box containing the gradient image and by an angle. The color of the gradient is defined by different points, the starting point, the ending point and, in between, optional stop-color points.</p> <p>The starting point is the point on the gradient line where the color starts. It is defined by the intersection between the gradient line and a perpendicular passing by the box corner which is in the same quadrant.</p> <p>Similarly the ending point is the point on the gradient line where the final color is reached. It can also be defined by an intersection between the gradient line and a perpendicular line issued by the nearby corner, but is more easily defined as the symmetric of the starting point, when a point reflection with an origin confounded with the center of the box.</p> <p>These somewhat complex definitions of the starting and ending points lead to an interesting property sometimes called <em>magic corners</em> : the nearby corners of the starting and ending points also have the same color as the respective starting and ending points.</p> <p>More than just the starting-point and ending-point colors can be specified. By defining additional color-stop points on the gradient line, the web developer can create a more customized transition between the starting and ending colors, or provide for a multi-color gradient. </p> <p>The linear-gradient syntax does not allow for repeating gradients, but by using color-stop points, a similar effect can be achieved. For true repeating gradients, use the <a title="The CSS repeating-linear-gradient function creates an &lt;image&gt; consisting of repeating gradients. It works similarly to the basic linear gradients as described by linear-gradient(), and takes the same arguments. However, it automatically repeats the color stops infinitely in both directions.

</pre> <h3 id="History_of_the_syntax">History of the syntax</h3> <p>The syntax of <code>linear-gradient</code> has evolved since the <a href="http://www.webkit.org/blog/175/introducing-css-gradients/" class="external" target="_blank">first Apple proposal</a> implemented in 2008:</p> <pre class="syntaxbox">-webkit-gradient(&lt;type&gt;, &lt;point&gt; [, &lt;radius&gt;]?, &lt;point&gt; [, &lt;radius&gt;]? [, &lt;stop&gt;]*)
</pre> <p>In the original syntax, the same function was used to create both linear and radial gradients. However, the parameters needed in each case were different, resulting in a syntax that varied with the value of the first parameter. The situation became more complicated if other types of gradients, like conical gradients, were added, requiring the use of functions and non-standard or inconsistent css value specifications. No draft was proposed to the W3C.</p> <p>An alternative syntax was proposed and implemented by Mozilla in 2009 In this syntax, two CSS functions would be required; one for linear gradients, and the other for radial gradients. However, this syntax never shipped in a released product. A third syntax was proposed. This third syntax simplified the syntax for linear gradients to:</p> <pre class="syntaxbox">-moz-linear-gradient([ [ [top | bottom] || [left | right] ],]? &lt;color-stop&gt;[, &lt;color-stop&gt;]+);
</pre> <p>The new syntax did not require the <code>to()</code>, <code>from()</code> and <code>color-stop()</code> functions, so they were dropped. The order of the <code>top</code>/<code>bottom</code> and <code>left</code>/<code>right</code> keywords was also recognized as unimportant, so Mozilla removed the constraint of having <code>top</code>/<code>bottom</code> defined first. </p> <p>But the new syntax had still had one drawback: it allowed only vertical and horizontal gradients. Finally, the syntax below was proposed to the W3C. Following two more changes to solve the limitation on the direction of gradients, it was added to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-css3-images-20110217/#ltlinear-gradient" target="_blank">CSS Images Values and Content Replacement Level 3 draft in 2011-02-17</a>.</p> <ul> <li>The support of an <a title="The &lt;angle&gt; CSS data type represents angle values. Positive angles represent clockwise angles, negative angles represent counterclockwise angles. Its syntax is a &lt;number&gt; data type immediately followed by the unit (deg, grad, rad or turn). Like for any CSS dimension, there is no space between the unit literal and the number." href="../angle/"><code>&lt;angle&gt;</code></a> as an origin, allowing gradients of any direction.</li> <li>The definition of the magic corner algorithm which eases the work of Web developers by allowing an easy definition of the exact color at the corners.</li> </ul> <p>The color interpolation is also defined as happening in the pre-multiplied color space, in order to prevent non esthetic grey to appear when using color with different opacity. This syntax was implemented, prefixed, by both Webkit, without dropping the original one, and Trident (IE 10):</p> <pre class="syntaxbox">linear-gradient( [ [ <a title="The &lt;angle&gt; CSS data type represents angle values.

</pre> <p>Unfortunately, the addition of the <a title="The &lt;angle&gt; CSS data type represents angle values. Positive angles represent clockwise angles, negative angles represent counterclockwise angles. Its syntax is a &lt;number&gt; data type immediately followed by the unit (deg, grad, rad or turn). Like for any CSS dimension, there is no space between the unit literal and the number." href="../angle/"><code>&lt;angle&gt;</code></a> values to the syntax introduced an incoherence: the angle indicates a destination, but the keywords indicate a starting point.See a <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2011Jun/0377.html" class="external" target="_blank">related W3C CSSWG thread</a> for some discussion. This was fixed by a new syntax where the keyword are directions too, and preceded by the <code>to</code> keyword, it was added to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-css3-images-20110908/#ltlinear-gradient" target="_blank">CSS Images Values and Content Replacement Level 3 draft in 2011-09-08</a>.</p> <pre class="syntaxbox">linear-gradient([ [ [ <a title="The &lt;angle&gt; CSS data type represents angle values.

</pre> <p>This should be the final syntax.</p> <p>A last semantic curiosity still exists between the prefixed variants and the unprefixed proposal. Following the initial Apple proposal, the prefixed variants of the syntax all uses the an <a title="The &lt;angle&gt; CSS data type represents angle values.

To be coherent with the rest of CSS, the specification defines an angle with <code>0deg</code> representing the North. To prevent sites using prefixed version of the property to get suddenly broken, even when adapting to the otherwise forward-compatible final syntax, they keep the original angle definition (<code>0deg</code> = East<code>)</code>. They will switch to the correct spec when unprefixing the property. Also, as they aren't incompatible, Gecko supports, prefixed, both the syntax with the <code>to</code> keyword and without. Here again, the syntax without the keyword will be dropped when unprefixing.</p> <p>In 2014, the syntax has been extended to add color interpolation hint.</p> <pre class="syntaxbox"><dfn>&lt;color-stop-list&gt;</dfn> =
