<h1>Media Queries: Using media queries</h1>
<p><span class="seoSummary">A <strong>media query</strong> consists of an optional media type and zero or more expressions that limit the style sheets' scope by using media features, such as width, height, and color. Media queries, added in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3" target="_blank">CSS3</a>, let the presentation of content be tailored to a specific range of output devices without having to change the content itself.</span></p> <h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2> <p>Media queries consist of an optional <a class="internal" href="../../@media/">media type</a> and can, as of the CSS3 specification, contain zero or more expressions, expressed as media features, which resolve to either true or false. The result of the query is true if the media type specified in the media query matches the type of device the document is being displayed on <strong>and</strong> all expressions in the media query are true.</p> <pre data-language="html">&lt;!-- CSS media query on a link element --&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" media="(max-width: 800px)" href="example.css" /&gt;

&lt;!-- CSS media query within a stylesheet --&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .facet_sidebar {
    display: none;
  }
}
&lt;/style&gt;</pre> <p>When a media query is true, the corresponding style sheet or style rules are applied, following the normal cascading rules. Style sheets with media queries attached to their <code><a title="The HTML &lt;link&gt; element specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. Possible uses for this element include defining a relational framework for navigation. This Element is most used to link to style sheets." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link" target="_blank"><code>&lt;link&gt;</code></a></code> tags <a href="http://scottjehl.github.com/CSS-Download-Tests/" target="_blank">will still download</a> even if their media queries would return false (they will not apply, however).</p> <p>Unless you use the <code>not</code> or <code>only</code> operators, the media type is optional and the <code>all</code> type will be implied.</p> <h3 id="Logical_operators">Logical operators</h3> <p>You can compose complex media queries using logical operators, including <code>not</code>, <code>and</code>, and <code>only</code>. The <code>and</code> operator is used for combining multiple <a href="#Media_features">media features</a> together into a single media query, requiring each chained feature to return true in order for the query to be true. The <code>not</code> operator is used to negate an entire media query. The <code>only</code> operator is used to apply a style only if the entire query matches, useful for preventing older browsers from applying selected styles. If you use the <code>not</code> or <code>only</code> operators, you <em>must</em> specify an explicit media type.</p> <p>You can also combine multiple media queries in a comma-separated list; if any of the media queries in the list is true, the entire media statement returns true. This is equivalent to an <code>or</code> operator.</p> <h4 id="and">and</h4> <p>The <code>and</code> keyword is used for combining multiple media features together, as well as combining media features with media types. A basic media query, a single media feature with the implied <code>all</code> media type, could look like this:</p> <pre data-language="css">@media (min-width: 700px) { ... }</pre> <p>If, however, you wanted this to apply only if the display is in landscape, you could use an <code>and</code> operator to chain the media features together.</p> <pre data-language="css">@media (min-width: 700px) and (orientation: landscape) { ... }</pre> <p>Now the above media query will only return true if the viewport is 700px wide or wider and the display is in landscape. If, however, you only wanted this to apply if the display in question was of the media type TV, you could chain these features with a media type using an <code>and</code> operator.</p> <pre data-language="css">@media tv and (min-width: 700px) and (orientation: landscape) { ...  }</pre> <p>Now, the above media query will only apply if the media type is TV, the viewport is 700px wide or wider, and the display is in landscape.</p> <h4 id="comma-separated_lists">comma-separated lists</h4> <p>Comma-separated lists behave like the logical operator <code>or</code> when used in media queries. When using a comma-separated list of media queries, if any of the media queries returns true, the styles or style sheets get applied. Each media query in a comma-separated list is treated as an individual query, and any operator applied to one media query does not affect the others. This means the comma-separated media queries can target different media features, types, and states.</p> <p>For instance, if you wanted to apply a set of styles if the viewing device either had a minimum width of 700px or was a handheld in landscape, you could write the following:</p> <pre data-language="css">@media (min-width: 700px), handheld and (orientation: landscape) { ... }</pre> <p>Above, if I were on a <code>screen</code> device with a viewport width of 800px, the media statement would return true because the first part, interpreted as <code>@media all and (min-width: 700px)</code> would apply to my device and therefore return true, despite the fact that my <code>screen</code> device would fail the <code>handheld</code> media type check in the second media query. Likewise, if I were on a <code>handheld</code> device held in landscape with a viewport width of 500px, while the first media query would fail due to the viewport width, the second media query would succeed and thus the media statement would return true.</p> <h4 id="not">not</h4> <p>The <code>not</code> keyword applies to the whole media query and returns true if the media query would otherwise return false (such as <code>monochrome</code> on a color display or a screen width of 600px with a <code>min-width: 700px</code> feature query). A <code>not</code> will only negate the media query it is applied to and not to every media query if present in a comma-separated list of media queries. The <code>not</code> keyword cannot be used to negate an individual feature query, only an entire media query. For example, the <code>not</code> is evaluated last in the following query:</p> <pre data-language="css">@media not all and (monochrome) { ... }
</pre> <p>This means that the query is evaluated like this:</p> <pre data-language="css">@media not (all and (monochrome)) { ... }
</pre> <p>... rather than like this:</p> <pre data-language="css">@media (not all) and (monochrome) { ... }</pre> <p>As another example, look at the following media query:</p> <pre data-language="css">@media not screen and (color), print and (color) { ... }
</pre> <p>It is evaluated like this:</p> <pre data-language="css">@media (not (screen and (color))), print and (color) { ... }</pre> <h4 id="only">only</h4> <p>The <code>only</code> keyword prevents older browsers that do not support media queries with media features from applying the given styles:</p> <pre data-language="html">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" media="only screen and (color)" href="example.css" /&gt;
</pre> <h3 id="Pseudo-BNF">Pseudo-BNF</h3> <pre class="syntaxbox">media_query_list: &lt;media_query&gt; [, &lt;media_query&gt; ]*
media_query: [[only | not]? &lt;media_type&gt; [ and &lt;expression&gt; ]*]

  | resolution | min-resolution | max-resolution
  | scan | grid</pre> <p>Media queries are case insensitive. Media queries involving unknown media types are always false.</p> <div class="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> Parentheses are required around expressions; failing to use them is an error.</div> <h2 id="Media_features">Media features</h2> <p>Most media features can be prefixed with "min-" or "max-" to express "minimum condition" or "maximum condition" constraints. For example, "max-width:12450px" means the highest condition for applying the styles is, the media have a screen with 12450px width. If the screen is wider than 12450px, the style will not be applied. This avoids using the "&lt;" and "&gt;" symbols, which would conflict with HTML and XML. If you use a media feature without specifying a value, the expression resolves to true if the feature's value is non-zero.</p> <div class="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> If a media feature doesn't apply to the device on which the browser is running, expressions involving that media feature are always false. For example, querying the aspect ratio of an aural device always results in false.</div> <h3 id="color">color</h3> <p><strong>Value:</strong> <a title="The &lt;integer&gt; CSS data type denotes an integer number, positive or negative.
