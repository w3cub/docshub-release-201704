<h1>Pseudo-classes</h1> <p>A CSS <strong><em><dfn>pseudo-class</dfn></em></strong> is a keyword added to selectors that specifies a special state of the element to be selected. For example <a title="The :hover CSS pseudo-class matches when the user designates an element with a pointing device, but does not necessarily activate it. This style may be overridden by any other link-related pseudo-classes, that is :link, :visited, and :active, appearing in subsequent rules. In order to style appropriately links, you need to put the :hover rule after the :link and :visited rules but before the :active one, as defined by the LVHA-order: :link — :visited — :hover — :active." href="../:hover/"><code>:hover</code></a> will apply a style when the user hovers over the element specified by the selector.</p> <p>Pseudo-classes, together with <a title="Just like pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements are added to selectors but instead of describing a special state, they allow you to style certain parts of a document. For example, the ::first-line pseudo-element targets only  the first line of an element specified by the selector." href="../pseudo-elements/"><code>pseudo-elements</code></a>, let you apply a style to an element not only in relation to the content of the document tree, but also in relation to external factors like the history of the navigator (<a title="The :visited CSS pseudo-class lets you select only links that have been visited.

The user can change this state by clicking on the element, or selecting a different value, in which case the :checked pseudo-class no longer applies to this element, but will to the relevant one.' href="../:checked/"><code>:checked</code></a> on some form elements), or the position of the mouse (like <a title="The :hover CSS pseudo-class matches when the user designates an element with a pointing device, but does not necessarily activate it.
