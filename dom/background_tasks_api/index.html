<h1>Background Tasks API</h1>
<div class="overheadIndicator draft"> <p><strong>Draft</strong><br> This page is not complete.</p> </div> <p>The <strong>Cooperative Scheduling of Background Tasks API</strong> (also referred to as the Background Tasks API or simply the <code>requestIdleCallback()</code> API) provides the ability to queue tasks to be executed automatically by the user agent when it determines that there is free time to do so.</p> <h2 id="Concepts_and_usage">Concepts and usage</h2> <p>The main thread of a Web browser is centered around its event loop. This code draws any pending updates to the <a title="The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content, which is the DOM tree. The DOM tree includes elements such as &lt;body&gt; and &lt;table&gt;, among many others. It provides functionality global to the document, like how to obtain the page's URL and create new elements in the document." href="../document/"><code>Document</code></a> currently being displayed, runs any JavaScript code the page needs to run, accepts events from input devices, and dispatches those events to the elements that should receive them. In addition, the event loop handles interactions with the operating system, updates to the browser's own user interface, and so forth. It's an extremely busy chunk of code, and your main JavaScript code may run right inside this thread along with all of this. Certainly most if not all code that is capable of making changes to the DOM is running in the main thread, since it's common for user interface changes to only be available to the main thread.</p> <p>Because event handling and screen updates are two of the most obvious ways users notice performance issues, it's important for your code to be a good citizen of the Web and help to prevent stalls in the execution of the event loop. In the past, there's been no way to do this reliably other than by writing code that's as efficient as possible and by offloading as much work as possible to <a href="../web_workers_api/">workers</a>. <a title="The window.requestIdleCallback() method queues a function to be called during a browser's idle periods. This enables developers to perform background and low priority work on the main event loop, without impacting latency-critical events such as animation and input response. Functions are generally called in first-in-first-out order; however, callbacks which have a timeout specified may be called out-of-order if necessary in order to run them before the timeout elapses." href="../window/requestidlecallback/"><code>Window.requestIdleCallback()</code></a> makes it possible to become actively engaged in helping to ensure that the browser's event loop runs smoothly, by allowing the browser to tell your code how much time it can safely use without causing the system to lag. If you stay within the limit given, you can make the user's experience much better.</p> <p>...</p> <h3 id="Getting_the_most_out_of_idle_callbacks">Getting the most out of idle callbacks</h3> <p>Because idle callbacks are intended to give your code a way to cooperate with the event loop to ensure that the system is utilized to its full potential without over-tasking it, resulting in lag or other performance problems, you should be thoughtful about how you go about using them.</p> <ul> <li>
<strong>Use idle callbacks for tasks which don't have high priority.</strong> Because you don't know how many callbacks have been established, and you don't know how busy the user's system is, you don't know how often your callback will be run (unless you specify a <code>timeout</code>. There's no guarantee that every pass through the event loop (or even every screen update cycle) will include any idle callbacks being executed; if the event loop uses all available time, you're out of luck (again, unless you've used a <code>timeout</code>).</li> <li>
<strong>Idle callbacks should do their best not to overrun the time allotted.</strong> While the browser, your code, and the Web in general will continue to run normally if you go over the specified time limit (even if you go<em>way</em> over it), the time restriction is intended to ensure that you leae the system enough time to finish the current pass through the event loop and get on to the next one without causing other code to stutter or animation effects to lag. Currently, <a title="The timeRemaining() method on the IdleDeadline interface returns the estimated number of milliseconds remaining in the current idle period. The callback can call this method at any time to determine how much time it can continue to work before it must return. For example, if the callback finishes a task and has another one to begin, it can call timeRemaining() to see if there's enough time to complete the next task. If there isn't, the callback can just return immediately, or look for other work to do with the remaining time." href="../idledeadline/timeremaining/"><code>timeRemaining()</code></a> has an upper limit of 50 milliseconds, but in reality you will often have less time than that, since the event loop may already be eating into that time on complex sites, with browser extensions needing processor time, and so forth.</li> <li>
<strong>Avoid making changes to the DOM within your idle callback.</strong> By the time your callback is run, the current frame has already finished drawing, and all layout updates and computations have been completed. If you make changes that affect layout, you may force a situation in which the browser has to stop and do recalculations that would otherwise be unnecessary. If your callback needs to change the DOM, it should use <a title="You should call this method whenever you're ready to update your animation onscreen. This will request that your animation function be called before the browser performs the next repaint. The number of callbacks is usually 60 times per second, but will generally match the display refresh rate in most web browsers as per W3C recommendation. The callback rate may be reduced to a lower rate when running in background tabs or in hidden &lt;iframe&gt;s in order to improve performance and battery life." href="../window/requestanimationframe/"><code>Window.requestAnimationFrame()</code></a> to schedule that.</li> <li>
<strong>Avoid tasks whose run time can't be predicted.</strong> Your idle callback should avoid doing anything that could take an unpredictable amount of time. For example, anything which might affect layout should be avoided. You should also avoid resolving or rejecting <a title="The Promise interface represents a proxy for a value not necessarily known at its creation time. It allows you to associate handlers to an asynchronous action's eventual success or failure. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise of having a value at some point in the future." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Promise" target="_blank"><code>Promise</code></a>s, since that would invoke the handler for that promise's resolution or rejection as soon as your callback returns.</li> <li>
<strong>Use timeouts when you need to, but only when you need to.</strong> Using timeouts can ensure that your code runs in a timely manner, but it can also allow you to cause lag or animation stutters by mandating that the browser call you when there's not enough time left for you to run without disrupting performance.</li> </ul> <h3 id="Falling_back_to_setTimeout">Falling back to setTimeout</h3> <p>Because the Background Tasks API is fairly new, your code may need to be able to work on browsers that don't yet support it. You can do so with a simple shim that uses <a title="Sets a timer which executes a function or specified piece of code once after the timer expires." href="../windoworworkerglobalscope/settimeout/"><code>setTimeout()</code></a> as a fallback option. This isn't a <a title="polyfill: A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript on the Web) used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/polyfill" class="glossaryLink" target="_blank">polyfill</a>, since it's not functionally identical; <code>setTimeout()</code> doesn't let you make use of idle periods, but instead runs your code when possible, leaving us to do the best we can to avoid causing the user to experience performance lag.</p> <pre data-language="js">window.requestIdleCallback = window.requestIdleCallback || function(handler) {
  let startTime = Date.now();
 
  return setTimeout(function() {
    handler({
      didTimeout: false,
      timeRemaining: function() {
        return Math.max(0, 50.0 - (Date.now() - startTime));
      }
    });
  }, 1);
}</pre> <p>If <a title="The window.requestIdleCallback() method queues a function to be called during a browser's idle periods. This enables developers to perform background and low priority work on the main event loop, without impacting latency-critical events such as animation and input response. Functions are generally called in first-in-first-out order; however, callbacks which have a timeout specified may be called out-of-order if necessary in order to run them before the timeout elapses." href="../window/requestidlecallback/"><code>window.requestIdleCalback</code></a> is undefined, we create it here. The function begins by recording the time at which our implementation was called. We'll be using that to compute the value returned by our shim for <a title="The timeRemaining() method on the IdleDeadline interface returns the estimated number of milliseconds remaining in the current idle period. The callback can call this method at any time to determine how much time it can continue to work before it must return. For example, if the callback finishes a task and has another one to begin, it can call timeRemaining() to see if there's enough time to complete the next task. If there isn't, the callback can just return immediately, or look for other work to do with the remaining time." href="../idledeadline/timeremaining/"><code>timeRemaining()</code></a>.</p> <p>Then we call <a title="Sets a timer which executes a function or specified piece of code once after the timer expires." href="../windoworworkerglobalscope/settimeout/"><code>setTimeout()</code></a>, passing into it a function which runs the callback passed into our implementation of <code>requestIdleCallback()</code>. The callback is passed an object which conforms to <a title="See our complete example in the article Cooperative Scheduling of Background Tasks API." href="../idledeadline/"><code>IdleDeadline</code></a>, with <a title="The read-only didTimeout property on the IdleDeadline interface is a Boolean value which indicates whether or not the idle callback is being invoked because the timeout interval specified when Window.requestIdleCallback() was called has expired." href="../idledeadline/didtimeout/"><code>didTimeout</code></a> set to <code>false</code> and a<a title="The timeRemaining() method on the IdleDeadline interface returns the estimated number of milliseconds remaining in the current idle period. The callback can call this method at any time to determine how much time it can continue to work before it must return. For example, if the callback finishes a task and has another one to begin, it can call timeRemaining() to see if there's enough time to complete the next task. If there isn't, the callback can just return immediately, or look for other work to do with the remaining time." href="../idledeadline/timeremaining/"><code>timeRemaining()</code></a> method which is implemented to give the callback 50 milliseconds of time to begin with. Each time <code>timeRemaining()</code> is called, it subtracts the elapsed time from the original 50 milliseconds to determine the amount of time left.</p> <p>As a result, while our shim doesn't constrain itself to the amount of idle time left in the current event loop pass like the true <code>requestIdleCallback()</code>, it does at least limit the callback to no more than 50 milliseconds of run time per pass.</p> <p>The implementation of our shim for <a title="The window.cancelIdleCallback() method cancels a callback previously scheduled with window.requestIdleCallback()." href="../window/cancelidlecallback/"><code>cancelIdleCallback()</code></a> is much simpler:</p> <pre data-language="js">window.cancelIdleCallback = window.cancelIdleCallback || function(id) {
  clearTimeout(id);
}</pre> <p>If <code>cancelIdleCallback()</code> isn't defined, thiscreates one which simply passes the specified callback ID through to <a title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/clearTimeout" target="_blank"><code>clearTimeout()</code></a>.</p> <p>Now your code will work even on browsers that don't support the Background Tasks API, albeit not as efficiently.</p> <h2 id="Interfaces">Interfaces</h2> <p>The Background Tasks API adds only one new interface:</p> <dl> <dt><a title="See our complete example in the article Cooperative Scheduling of Background Tasks API." href="../idledeadline/"><code>IdleDeadline</code></a></dt> <dd>An object of this type is passed to the idle callback to provide an estimate of how long the idle period is expected to last, as well as whether or not the callback is running because its timeout period has expired.</dd> </dl> <p>The <a title="The window object represents a window containing a DOM document; the document property points to the DOM document loaded in that window." href="../window/"><code>Window</code></a> interface is also augmented by this API to offer the new <a title="The window.requestIdleCallback() method queues a function to be called during a browser's idle periods.

In addition, this example demonstrates how to schedule updates to the document content using <a title="You should call this method whenever you're ready to update your animation onscreen.

The CSS is not shown, since it's not particularly crucial to understanding this functionality.</p> <h3 id="HTML_content">HTML content</h3> <p>In order to be oriented about what we're trying to accomplish, let's have a look at the HTML. This establishes a box (ID <code>"Container"</code>) that's used to present the progress of an operation (because you never know how long decoding "quantum filament tachyon emissions" will take, after all) as well as a second main box (with the ID <code>"logBox"</code>), which is used to display textual output.</p> <pre data-language="html">&lt;p&gt;
  Demonstration of using &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Background_Tasks_API"&gt;
  cooperatively scheduled background tasks&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;code&gt;requestIdleCallback()&lt;/code&gt;
  method.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="label"&gt;Decoding quantum filament tachyon emissions...&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;progress id="progress" value="0"&gt;&lt;/progress&gt;
  &lt;div class="button" id="startButton"&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="logBox"&gt;
  &lt;div class="logHeader"&gt;
    Log
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id="log"&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre> <p>The progress box uses a <a title="The HTML &lt;progress&gt; element represents the completion progress of a task, typically displayed as a progress bar." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/progress" target="_blank"><code>&lt;progress&gt;</code></a> element to show the progress, along with a label with sections that are changed to present numeric information about the progress. In addition, there's a "Start" button (creatively given the ID "startButton"), which the user will use to start the data processing.</p>  <h3 id="JavaScript_content">JavaScript content</h3> <p>Now that the document structure is defined, construct the JavaScript code that will do the work. The goal: to be able to add requests to call functions to a queue, with an idle callback that runs those functions whenever the system is idle for long enough a time to make progress.</p> <h4 id="Variable_declarations">Variable declarations</h4> <pre data-language="js">let taskList = [];
let totalTaskCount = 0;
let currentTaskNumber = 0;
let taskHandle = null;
</pre> <p>These variables are used to manage the list of tasks that are waiting to be performed, as well as status information about the task queue and its execution:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>taskList</code> is an <a title="The JavaScript Array object is a global object that is used in the construction of arrays; which are high-level, list-like objects." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array" target="_blank"><code>Array</code></a> of objects, each representing one task waiting to be run.</li> <li>
<code>totalTaskCount</code> is a counter of the number of tasks that have been added to the queue; it will only go up, never down. We use this to do the math to present progress as a precentage of total work to do.</li> <li>
<code>currentTaskNumber</code> is used to track how many tasks have been processed so far.</li> <li>
<code>taskHandle</code> is a reference to the task currently being processed.</li> </ul> <pre data-language="js">let totalTaskCountElem = document.getElementById("totalTaskCount");
let currentTaskNumberElem = document.getElementById("currentTaskNumber");
let progressBarElem = document.getElementById("progress");
let startButtonElem = document.getElementById("startButton");
let logElem = document.getElementById("log");
</pre> <p>Next we have variables which reference the DOM elements we need to interact with. These elements are:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>totalTaskCountElem</code> is the <a title="The HTML &lt;span&gt; element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span" target="_blank"><code>&lt;span&gt;</code></a> we use to insert the total numberof tasks created into the status display in the progress box.</li> <li>
<code>currentTaskNumberElem</code> is the element used to display the number of tasks processed so far.</li> <li>
<code>progressBarElem</code> is the <a title="The HTML &lt;progress&gt; element represents the completion progress of a task, typically displayed as a progress bar." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/progress" target="_blank"><code>&lt;progress&gt;</code></a> element showing the percentage of the tasks processed so far.</li> <li>
<code>startButtonElem</code> is the start button.</li> <li>
<code>logElem</code> is the <a title="The HTML &lt;div&gt; element is the generic container for flow content and does not inherently represent anything. Use it to group elements for purposes such as styling (using the class or id attributes), marking a section of a document in a different language (using the lang attribute), and so on." href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div" target="_blank"><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></a> we'll insert logged text messages into.</li> </ul> <pre data-language="js">let logFragment = null;
let statusRefreshScheduled = false;
</pre> <p>Finally, we set up a couple of variables for other items:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>logFragment</code> will be used to store a <a title="The DocumentFragment interface represents a minimal document object that has no parent. It is used as a light-weight version of Document to store a segment of a document structure comprised of nodes just like a standard document.

<code>statusRefreshScheduled</code> is used to track whether or not we've already scheduled an update of the status display box for the upcoming frame, so that we only do it once per frame</li> </ul>  <h4 id="Managing_the_task_queue">Managing the task queue</h4> <p>Next, let's look at the way we manage the tasks that need to be performed. We're going to do this by creating a FIFO queue of tasks, which we'll run as time allows during the idle callback period.</p> <h5 id="Enqueueing_tasks">Enqueueing tasks</h5> <p>First, we need a function that enqueues tasks for future execution. That function, <code>enqueueTask()</code>, looks like this:</p> <pre data-language="js">function enqueueTask(taskHandler, taskData) {
  taskList.push({
    handler: taskHandler,
    data: taskData
  });
 
  totalTaskCount++;
 
  if (!taskHandle) {
    taskHandle = requestIdleCallback(runTaskQueue, { timeout: 1000 });
  }
 
  scheduleStatusRefresh();
}
</pre> <p><code>enqueueTask()</code> accepts as input two parameters:</p> <ul> <li>
<code>taskHandler</code> is a function which will be called to handle the task.</li> <li>
<code>taskData</code> is an object which is passed into the task handler as an input parameter, to allow the task to receive custom data.</li> </ul> <p>To enqueue the task, we <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push" target="_blank">push</a> an object onto the <code>taskList</code> array; the object contains the <code>taskHandler</code> and <code>taskData</code> values under the names <code>handler</code> and <code>data</code>, respectively, then increment <code>totalTaskCount</code>, which reflects the total number of tasks which have ever been enqueued (we don't decrement it when tasks are removed from the queue).</p> <p>Next, we check to see if we already have an idle callback created; if <code>taskHandle</code> is 0, we know there isn't an idle callback yet, so we call <a title="The window.requestIdleCallback() method queues a function to be called during a browser's idle periods.

It's configured to call a function called <code>runTaskQueue()</code>, which we'll look at shortly, and with a <code>timeout</code> of 1 second, so that it will be run at least once per second even if there isn't any actual idle time available.</p> <h5 id="Running_tasks">Running tasks</h5> <p>Our idle callback handler, runTaskQueue(), gets called when the browser determines there's enough idle time available to let us do some work or our timeout of one second expires. This function's job is to run our enqueued tasks.</p> <pre data-language="js">function runTaskQueue(deadline) {
  while ((deadline.timeRemaining() &gt; 0 || deadline.didTimeout) &amp;&amp; taskList.length) {
    let task = taskList.shift();
    currentTaskNumber++;
    
    task.handler(task.data);
    scheduleStatusRefresh();
  }
 
  if (taskList.length) {
    taskHandle = requestIdleCallback(runTaskQueue, { timeout: 1000} );
  } else {
    taskHandle = 0;
  }
}
</pre> <p><code>runTaskQueue()</code>'s core is a loop which continues as long as there's time left (as determined by checking <a title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Deadline/timeRemaining" target="_blank"><code>IdleDeadline.timeRemaining</code></a>) to be sure it's more than 0 or if the timeout limit was reached (<a title="The read-only didTimeout property on the IdleDeadline interface is a Boolean value which indicates whether or not the idle callback is being invoked because the timeout interval specified when Window.requestIdleCallback() was called has expired." href="../idledeadline/didtimeout/"><code>deadline.didTimeout</code></a> is true), and as long as there are tasks in the task list.</p> <p>For each task in the queue that we have time to execute, we do the following:</p> <ol> <li>We <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/shift" target="_blank">remove the task object from the queue</a>.</li> <li>We increment <code>currentTaskNumber</code> to track how many tasks we've executed.</li> <li>We call the task's handler, <code>task.handler</code>, passing into it the task's data object (<code>task.data</code>).</li> <li>We call a function, <code>scheduleStatusRefresh()</code>, to handle scheduling a screen update to reflect changes to our progress.</li> </ol> <p>When time runs out, if there are still tasks left in the list, we call <a title="The window.requestIdleCallback() method queues a function to be called during a browser's idle periods.
