For most keys, Gecko dispatches a sequence of key events like this:</p> <ol> <li>When the key is first depressed, the <code>keydown</code> event is sent.</li> <li>If the key is not a modifier key, the <code>keypress</code> event is sent.</li> <li>When the user releases the key, the <code>keyup</code> event is sent.</li> </ol> <h3 id="Special_cases">Special cases</h3> <p>Some keys toggle the state of an indicator light; these include keys such as Caps Lock, Num Lock, and Scroll Lock. On Windows and Linux, these keys dispatch only the <code>keydown</code> and <code>keyup</code> events.</p> <div class="note"> <p>On Linux, Firefox 12 and earlier also dispatched the <code>keypress</code> event for these keys.</p> </div> <p>However, a limitation of the Mac OS X event model causes Caps Lock to dispatche only the <code>keydown</code> event. Num Lock was supported on some older laptop models (2007 models and older), but since then, Mac OS X hasn't supported Num Lock even on external keyboards. On older MacBooks with a Num Lock key, that key doesn't generate any key events. Gecko does support the Scroll Lock key if an external keyboard which has an F14 key is connected. In certain older versions of Firefox, this key generated a <code>keypress</code> event; this inconsistent behavior was <a title="FIXED: Inconsistency whether keypress event is dispatched or not of CapsLock, NumLock and ScrollLock keys" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=602812" target="_blank">bug 602812</a>.</p> <h3 id="Auto-repeat_handling">Auto-repeat handling</h3> <p>When a key is pressed and held down, it begins to auto-repeat. This results in a sequence of events similar to the following being dispatched:</p> <ol> <li><code>keydown</code></li> <li><code>keypress</code></li> <li><code>keydown</code></li> <li><code>keypress</code></li> <li>&lt;&lt;repeating until the user releases the key&gt;&gt;</li> <li><code>keyup</code></li> </ol> <p>This is what the DOM Level 3 specification says should happen. There are some caveats, however, as described below.</p> <h4 id="Auto-repeat_on_some_GTK_environments_such_as_Ubuntu_9.4">Auto-repeat on some GTK environments such as Ubuntu 9.4</h4> <p>In some GTK-based environments, auto-repeat dispatches a native key-up event automatically during auto-repeat, and there's no way for Gecko to know the difference between a repeated series of keypresses and an auto-repeat. On those platforms, then, an auto-repeat key will generate the following sequence of events:</p> <ol> <li><code>keydown</code></li> <li><code>keypress</code></li> <li><code>keyup</code></li> <li><code>keydown</code></li> <li><code>keypress</code></li> <li><code>keyup</code></li> <li>&lt;&lt;repeating until the user releases the key&gt;&gt;</li> <li><code>keyup</code></li> </ol> <p>In these environments, unfortunately, there's no way for web content to tell the difference between auto-repeating keys and keys that are just being pressed repeatedly.</p> <h4 id="Auto-repeat_handling_prior_to_Gecko_5.0">Auto-repeat handling prior to Gecko 5.0</h4> <p>Before Gecko 5.0 (Firefox 5.0 / Thunderbird 5.0 / SeaMonkey 2.2), keyboard handling was less consistent across platforms.</p> <dl> <dt>Windows</dt> <dd>Auto-repeat behavior is the same as in Gecko 4.0 and later.</dd> <dt>Mac</dt> <dd>After the initial keydown event, only keypress events are sent until the keyup event occurs; the inter-spaced keydown events are not sent.</dd> <dt>Linux</dt> <dd>The event behavior depends on the specific platform. It will either behave like Windows or Mac depending on what the native event model does.</dd> </dl> <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> manually firing an event does <em>not</em> generate the default action associated with that event. For example, manually firing a key event does not cause that letter to appear in a focused text input. In the case of UI events, this is important for security reasons, as it prevents scripts from simulating user actions that interact with the browser itself.</p> <h2 id="Example">Example</h2> <pre data-language="js">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
