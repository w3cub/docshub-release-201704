<h1>Web Speech API</h1>
<div><div class="notice experimental"> <p> <strong>This is an experimental technology</strong><br>Because this technology's specification has not stabilized, check the <a href="#Browser_compatibility">compatibility table</a> for usage in various browsers. Also note that the syntax and behavior of an experimental technology is subject to change in future versions of browsers as the specification changes.</p> </div></div> <div class="summary"> <p>The Web Speech API enables you to incorporate voice data into web apps. The Web Speech API has two parts: SpeechSynthesis (Text-to-Speech), and SpeechRecognition (Asynchronous Speech Recognition.)</p> </div> <h2 id="Web_Speech_Concepts_and_Usage">Web Speech Concepts and Usage</h2> <p>The Web Speech API makes web apps able to handle voice data. There are two components to this API:</p> <ul> <li>Speech recogition is accessed via the <a href="../speechrecognition/" title="The SpeechRecognition interface of the Web Speech API is the controller interface for the recognition service; this also handles the SpeechRecognitionEvent sent from the recognition service."><code>SpeechRecognition</code></a> interface, which provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input (normally via the device's default speech recognition service) and respond appropriately. Generally you'll use the interface's constructor to create a new <a href="../speechrecognition/" title="The SpeechRecognition interface of the Web Speech API is the controller interface for the recognition service; this also handles the SpeechRecognitionEvent sent from the recognition service."><code>SpeechRecognition</code></a> object, which has a number of event handlers available for detecting when speech is input through the device's microphone. The <a href="../speechgrammar/" title="The SpeechGrammar interface of the Web Speech API represents a set of words or patterns of words that we want the recognition service to recognize."><code>SpeechGrammar</code></a> interface represents a container for a particular set of grammar that your app should recognise. Grammar is defined using <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/jsgf/" target="_blank">JSpeech Grammar Format</a> (<strong>JSGF</strong>.)</li> <li>Speech synthesis is accessed via the <a href="../speechsynthesis/" title="The SpeechSynthesis interface of the Web Speech API is the controller interface for the speech service; this can be used to retrieve information about the synthesis voices available on the device, start and pause speech, and other commands besides."><code>SpeechSynthesis</code></a> interface, a text-to-speech component that allows programs to read out their text content (normally via the device's default speech synthesiser.) Different voice types are represented by <a href="../speechsynthesisvoice/" title="The SpeechSynthesisVoice interface of the Web Speech API represents a voice that the system supports. Every SpeechSynthesisVoice has its own relative speech service including information about language, name and URI."><code>SpeechSynthesisVoice</code></a> objects, and different parts of text that you want to be spoken are represented by <a href="../speechsynthesisutterance/" title="The SpeechSynthesisUtterance interface of the Web Speech API represents a speech request. It contains the content the speech service should read and information about how to read it (e.g. language, pitch and volume.)"><code>SpeechSynthesisUtterance</code></a> objects. You can get these spoken by passing them to the <a href="../speechsynthesis/speak/" title="The speak() method of the SpeechSynthesis interface adds an utterance to the utterance queue; it will be spoken when any other utterances queued before it have been spoken."><code>SpeechSynthesis.speak()</code></a> method.</li> </ul> <p>For more details on using these features, see <a href="../web_speech_api/using_the_web_speech_api/">Using the Web Speech API</a>.</p> <h2 id="Web_Speech_API_Interfaces">Web Speech API Interfaces</h2> <h3 id="Speech_recognition">Speech recognition</h3> <dl> <dt><a href="../speechrecognition/" title="The SpeechRecognition interface of the Web Speech API is the controller interface for the recognition service;
