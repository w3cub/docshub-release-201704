<h1>Web Workers API</h1> <p class="summary"><strong>Web Workers</strong> are a mechanism by which a script operation can be made to run in a background thread separate from the main execution thread of a web application. The advantage of this is that laborious processing can be performed in a separate thread, allowing the main (usually the UI) thread to run without being blocked/slowed down.</p> <h2 id="Web_Workers_concepts_and_usage">Web Workers concepts and usage</h2> <p>A worker is an object created using <code>a</code> constructor (e.g. <a href="../worker/worker/" title="The Worker() constructor creates a Worker object that executes the script at the specified URL. This script must obey the same-origin policy."><code>Worker()</code></a>) that runs a named JavaScript file — this file contains the code that will run in the worker thread; workers run in another global context that is different from the current <a href="../window/" title="The window object represents a window containing a DOM document; the document property points to the DOM document loaded in that window."><code>window</code></a>. This context is represented by a <a href="../dedicatedworkerglobalscope/" title="The DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope object (the Worker global scope) is accessible through the self keyword. Some additional global functions, namespaces objects, and constructors, not typically associated with the worker global scope, but available on it, are listed in the JavaScript Reference. See also: Functions available to workers."><code>DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope</code></a> object in the case of dedicated workers (standard workers that are utilized by a single script; shared workers use <a href="../sharedworkerglobalscope/" title="The SharedWorkerGlobalScope object (the SharedWorker global scope) is accessible through the self keyword. Some additional global functions, namespaces objects, and constructors, not typically associated with the worker global scope, but available on it, are listed in the JavaScript Reference. See the complete list of functions available to workers."><code>SharedWorkerGlobalScope</code></a>).</p> <p>You can run whatever code you like inside the worker thread, with some exceptions. For example, you can't directly manipulate the DOM from inside a worker, or use some default methods and properties of the <a href="../window/" title="The window object represents a window containing a DOM document; the document property points to the DOM document loaded in that window."><code>window</code></a> object. But you can use a large number of items available under <code>window</code>, including <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebSockets" target="_blank">WebSockets</a>, and data storage mechanisms like <a href="../indexeddb_api/">IndexedDB</a> and the Firefox OS-only <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Data_Store_API" target="_blank">Data Store API</a>. See <a href="../web_workers_api/functions_and_classes_available_to_workers/">Functions and classes available to workers</a> for more details.</p> <p>Data is sent between workers and the main thread via a system of messages — both sides send their messages using the <code>postMessage()</code> method, and respond to messages via the <code>onmessage</code> event handler (the message is contained within the <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Message" title="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Message" target="_blank">Message</a></code> event's data attribute). The data is copied rather than shared.</p> <p>Workers may in turn spawn new workers, as long as those workers are hosted within the same origin as the parent page. In addition, workers may use <a href="../xmlhttprequest/" class="internal"><code>XMLHttpRequest</code></a> for network I/O, with the exception that the <code>responseXML</code> and <code>channel</code> attributes on <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> always return <code>null</code>.</p> <p>In addition to dedicated workers, there are other types of worker:</p> <ul> <li>Shared workers are workers that can be utilized by multiple scripts running in different windows, IFrames, etc., as long as they are in the same domain as the worker. They are a little more complex than dedicated workers — scripts must communicate via an active port. See <a href="../sharedworker/" title="The SharedWorker interface represents a specific kind of worker that can be accessed from several browsing contexts, such as several windows, iframes or even workers. They implement an interface different than dedicated workers and have a different global scope, SharedWorkerGlobalScope."><code>SharedWorker</code></a> for more details.</li> <li>
<a href="../service_worker_api/">ServiceWorkers</a> essentially act as proxy servers that sit between web applications, and the browser and network (when available). They are intended to (amongst other things) enable the creation of effective offline experiences, intercepting network requests and taking appropriate action based on whether the network is available and updated assets reside on the server. They will also allow access to push notifications and background sync APIs.</li> <li>Chrome Workers are a Firefox-only type of worker that you can use if you are developing add-ons and want to use workers in extensions and have access to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/js-ctypes" target="_blank">js-ctypes</a> in your worker. See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ChromeWorker" title="If you're developing privileged code, and would like to create a worker that can use js-ctypes to perform calls to native code, you can do so by using ChromeWorker instead of the standard Worker object. It works exactly like a standard Worker, except that it has access to js-ctypes via a global ctypes object available in the global scope of the worker. Examples of ChromeWorker's using js-ctypes are availabe on Github and are linked to from the See Also section below. To use a postMessage with callback version of ChromeWorker that features promises, see PromiseWorker." target="_blank"><code>ChromeWorker</code></a> for more details. </li> <li>
