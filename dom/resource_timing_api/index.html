<h1>Resource Timing API</h1> <p>The <strong><code>Resource Timing</code></strong> interfaces enable retrieving and analyzing detailed network timing data regarding the loading of an application's <em>resource(s)</em>. An application can use the timing metrics to determine, for example, the length of time it takes to load a specific resource, such as an <a title="XMLHttpRequest is an API that provides client functionality for transferring data between a client and a server.

The last three timestamps are, in order: <a title="The requestStart property returns a timestamp of the time immediately before the browser starts requesting the resource from the server, cache, or local resource.
