<h1>SharedWorkerGlobalScope</h1> <p>The <strong><code>SharedWorkerGlobalScope</code></strong> object (the <a title="The SharedWorker interface represents a specific kind of worker that can be accessed from several browsing contexts, such as several windows, iframes or even workers.

It can be used with dot notation on a window object (that is, window.self) or standalone (self). The advantage of the standalone notation is that a similar notation exists for non-window contexts, such as in Web Workers. By using self, you can refer to the global scope in a way that will work not only in a window context (self will resolve to window.self) but also in a worker context (self will then resolve to WorkerGlobalScope.self)." href="../window/self/"><code>self</code></a> keyword.
