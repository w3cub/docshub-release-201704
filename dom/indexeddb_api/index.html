<h1>IndexedDB API</h1> <p>IndexedDB is a low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data, including files/blobs. This API uses indexes to enable high performance searches of this data. While <a href="../storage/">DOM Storage</a> is useful for storing smaller amounts of data, it is less useful for storing larger amounts of structured data. IndexedDB provides a solution. This is the main landing page for MDN's IndexedDB coverage — here we provide links to the full API reference and usage guides, browser support details, and some explanation of key concepts.</p> <div class="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> This feature is available in <a href="../web_workers_api/">Web Workers</a>.</div> <div class="note"> <p><strong>Note</strong>: IndexedDB API is powerful, but may seem too complicated for simple cases. If you'd prefer a simple API, try libraries such as <a href="https://localforage.github.io/localForage/" target="_blank">localForage</a>, <a href="http://www.dexie.org/" target="_blank">dexie.js</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/erikolson186/zangodb" target="_blank">ZangoDB</a>, that make IndexedDB more user-friendly.</p> </div> <h2 id="Key_concepts_and_usage">Key concepts and usage</h2> <p>IndexedDB is a transactional database system, like an SQL-based RDBMS. However, unlike SQL-based RDBMSes, which use fixed-column tables, IndexedDB is a JavaScript-based object-oriented database. IndexedDB lets you store and retrieve objects that are indexed with a <strong>key</strong>; any objects supported by the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/The_structured_clone_algorithm" target="_blank">structured clone algorithm</a> can be stored. You need to specify the database schema, open a connection to your database, and then retrieve and update data within a series of <strong>transactions</strong>.</p> <ul> <li>Read more about the <a href="../indexeddb_api/basic_concepts_behind_indexeddb/">Concepts behind IndexedDB</a>.</li> <li>Learn to use IndexedDB asynchronously from first principles with our <a href="../indexeddb_api/using_indexeddb/">Using IndexedDB</a> guide.</li> <li>Find developer recommendations for making web apps work offline at our <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Build/Offline" target="_blank">Offline Apps</a> page.</li> </ul> <div class="note"> <p><strong>Note</strong>: Like most web storage solutions, IndexedDB follows a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Security/wiki/Same_Origin_Policy" class="external" target="_blank">same-origin policy</a>. So while you can access stored data within a domain, you cannot access data across different domains.</p> </div> <h3 id="Synchronous_and_asynchronous">Synchronous and asynchronous</h3> <p>Operations performed using IndexedDB are done asynchronously, so as not to block applications. IndexedDB originally included both synchronous and <span style="background-color: #f5f6f5;">asynchronous</span> APIs. The synchronous API was intended for use only with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Performance/Using_web_workers" target="_blank">Web Workers</a>, but was removed from the spec because it was unclear whether it was needed. However, <span style="background-color: #f5f6f5;"> the synchronous API</span> may be reintroduced if there is enough demand from web developers.</p> <h3 id="Storage_limits_and_eviction_criteria">Storage limits and eviction criteria</h3> <p>There are a number of web technologies that store data of one kind or another on the client side (i.e. on your local disk). IndexedDB is the most commonly talked about one. The process by which the browser works out how much space to allocate to web data storage and what to delete when that limit is reached is not simple, and differs between browsers. <a href="../indexeddb_api/browser_storage_limits_and_eviction_criteria/">Browser storage limits and eviction criteria</a> attempts to explain how this works, at least in the case of Firefox.</p> <h2 id="Interfaces">Interfaces</h2> <p>To get access to a database, call <a href="../idbfactory/open/"><code>open()</code></a> on the <a href="../windoworworkerglobalscope/indexeddb/"><code>indexedDB</code></a> attribute of a <a href="../window/">window</a> object.
