<h1>Web Audio API</h1>
<div> <p>The Web Audio API provides a powerful and versatile system for controlling audio on the Web, allowing developers to choose audio sources, add effects to audio, create audio visualizations, apply spatial effects (such as panning) and much more.</p> </div> <h2 id="Web_audio_concepts_and_usage">Web audio concepts and usage</h2> <p>The Web Audio API involves handling audio operations inside an <strong>audio context</strong>, and has been designed to allow <strong>modular routing</strong>. Basic audio operations are performed with <strong>audio nodes</strong>, which are linked together to form an <strong>audio routing graph</strong>. Several sources — with different types of channel layout — are supported even within a single context. This modular design provides the flexibility to create complex audio functions with dynamic effects.</p> <p>Audio nodes are linked into chains and simple webs by their inputs and outputs. They typically start with one or more sources. Sources provide arrays of sound intensities (samples) at very small timeslices, often tens of thousands of them per second. These could be either computed mathematically (such as <a title="The OscillatorNode interface represents a periodic waveform, such as a sine wave. It is an AudioScheduledSourceNode audio-processing module that causes a specified frequency of a given wave to be created—in effect, a constant tone." href="../oscillatornode/"><code>OscillatorNode</code></a>), or they can be recordings from sound/video files (like <a title="The AudioBufferSourceNode interface represents an audio source consisting of in-memory audio data, stored in an AudioBuffer. It is an AudioNode that acts as an audio source." href="../audiobuffersourcenode/"><code>AudioBufferSourceNode</code></a> and <a title="A MediaElementSourceNode has no inputs and exactly one output, and is created using the AudioContext.createMediaElementSource method. The amount of channels in the output equals the number of channels of the audio referenced by the HTMLMediaElement used in the creation of the node, or is 1 if the HTMLMediaElement has no audio." href="../mediaelementaudiosourcenode/"><code>MediaElementAudioSourceNode</code></a>) and audio streams (<a title="A MediaElementSourceNode has no inputs and exactly one output, and is created using the AudioContext.createMediaStreamSource method. The amount of channels in the output equals the number of channels in AudioMediaStreamTrack. If there is no valid media stream, then the number of output channels will be one silent channel." href="../mediastreamaudiosourcenode/"><code>MediaStreamAudioSourceNode</code></a>). In fact, sound files are just recordings of sound intensities themselves, which come in from microphones or electric instruments, and get mixed down into a single, complicated wave.</p> <p>Outputs of these nodes could be linked to inputs of others, which mix or modify these streams of sound samples into different streams. A common modification is multiplying the samples by a value to make them louder or quieter (as is the case with <a title="The gain is a unitless value, changing with time, that is multiplied to each corresponding sample of all input channels. If modified, the new gain is applied using a de-zippering algorithm in order to prevent unaesthetic 'clicks' from appearing in the resulting audio." href="../gainnode/"><code>GainNode</code></a>). Once the sound has been sufficiently processed for the intended effect, it can be linked to the input of a destination (<a title="An AudioDestinationNode." href="../audiocontext/destination/"><code>AudioContext.destination</code></a>), which sends the sound to the speakers or headphones. This last connection is only necessary if the user is supposed to hear the audio.</p> <p>A simple, typical workflow for web audio would look something like this:</p> <ol> <li>Create audio context</li> <li>Inside the context, create sources — such as <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>, oscillator, stream</li> <li>Create effects nodes, such as reverb, biquad filter, panner, compressor</li> <li>Choose final destination of audio, for example your system speakers</li> <li>Connect the sources up to the effects, and the effects to the destination.</li> </ol> <p><img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/12241/webaudioAPI_en.svg" alt="A simple box diagram with an outer box labeled Audio context, and three inner boxes labeled Sources, Effects and Destination. The three inner boxes have arrow between them pointing from left to right, indicating the flow of audio information." style="display: block; height: 143px; margin: 0px auto; width: 643px;"></p> <p>Timing is controlled with high precision and low latency, allowing developers to write code that responds accurately to events and is able to target specific samples, even at a high sample rate. So applications such as drum machines and sequencers are well within reach.</p> <p>The Web Audio API also allows us to control how audio is <em>spatialized</em>. Using a system based on a <em>source-listener model</em>, it allows control of the <em>panning model</em> and deals with <em>distance-induced attenuation</em> or <em>doppler shift</em> induced by a moving source (or moving listener).</p> <div class="note"> <p>You can read about the theory of the Web Audio API in a lot more detail in our article <a href="../web_audio_api/basic_concepts_behind_web_audio_api/">Basic concepts behind Web Audio API</a>.</p> </div> <h2 id="Web_Audio_API_Interfaces">Web Audio API Interfaces</h2> <p>The Web Audio API has a number of interfaces and associated events, which we have split up into nine categories of functionality.</p> <h3 id="General_audio_graph_definition">General audio graph definition</h3> <p>General containers and definitions that shape audio graphs in Web Audio API usage.</p> <dl> <dt><a title="An AudioContext can be a target of events, therefore it implements the EventTarget interface." href="../audiocontext/"><code>AudioContext</code></a></dt> <dd>The <strong><code>AudioContext</code></strong> interface represents an audio-processing graph built from audio modules linked together, each represented by an <a title="The AudioNode interface is a generic interface for representing an audio processing module like an audio source (e.g. an HTML &lt;audio&gt; or &lt;video&gt; element, an OscillatorNode, etc.), the audio destination, intermediate processing module (e.g. a filter like BiquadFilterNode or ConvolverNode), or volume control (like GainNode)." href="../audionode/"><code>AudioNode</code></a>.
