<h1>HTML Drag and Drop API</h1> <p><span class="seoSummary">HTML Drag and Drop interfaces enable applications to use drag and drop features in Firefox and other browsers.</span> For example, with these features, the user can select <em>draggable</em> elements with a mouse, drag the elements to a <em>droppable</em> element, and drop those elements by releasing the mouse button. A translucent representation of the <em>draggable</em> elements follows the mouse pointer during the drag operation.</p> <p>For web sites, extensions, and XUL applications, you can customize the types of elements that can become <em>draggable</em> elements, and the type of feedback the <em>draggable</em> elements produce, and the <em>droppable</em> elements.</p> <p>This document is an <em>overview</em> of HTML drag and drop. It includes a description of the interfaces, the basic steps to add drag and drop support to an application and a summary of the interoperability of the interfaces.</p> <h2 id="Drag_Events">Drag Events</h2> <p>HTML drag and drop uses the <a href="../event/" title="The Event interface represents any event which takes place in the DOM; some are user-generated (such as mouse or keyboard events), while others are generated by APIs (such as events that indicate an animation has finished running, a video has been paused, and so forth). There are many types of event, some of which use are other interfaces based on the main Event interface. Event itself contains the properties and methods which are common to all events."><code>DOM event model</code></a> and <em><a href="../dragevent/" title="The DragEvent interface is a DOM event that represents a drag and drop interaction.

A typical drag operation begins when a user selects a <em>draggable</em> element with a mouse, moves the mouse to a <em>droppable</em> element and then releases the mouse. During the operations, several event types are fired and some event types might be fired many times (for example the <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/drag" title="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/drag" target="_blank">drag</a></code> and <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/dragover" title="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/dragover" target="_blank">dragover</a></code> event types).</p> <p>All of the <a href="../dragevent/#Event_types">drag event types</a> have an associated <a href="../dragevent/#GlobalEventHandlers">global event handler</a>.

</h3> <p>The handler for the <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/drop" title="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/drop" target="_blank">drop</a></code> event is free to process the drag data in an application specific way. Typically, an application will use the <a href="../datatransfer/getdata/" title="The DataTransfer.getData() method retrieves drag data (as a DOMString) for the specified type. If the drag operation does not include data, this method returns an empty string."><code>getData()</code></a> method to retrieve drag items and process them accordingly. Additionally, application semantics may differ depending on the value of the <a href="../datatransfer/dropeffect/" title="The DataTransfer.dropEffect property controls the feedback (typically visual) the user is given during a drag and drop operation. It will affect which cursor is displayed while dragging. For example, when the user hovers over a target drop element, the browser's cursor may indicate which type of operation will occur."><code>dropEffect</code></a> and/or the state of modifier keys.</p> <p>The following example shows a drop handler getting the source element's id from the drag data and then using the id to move the source element to the drop element.</p> <pre data-language="js">function dragstart_handler(ev) {
 ev.preventDefault();
 // Add the target element's id to the data transfer object
 ev.dataTransfer.setData("text/plain", ev.target.id);
