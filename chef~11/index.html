<h1 id="an-overview-of-chef">An Overview of Chef</h1> <p>Welcome to Chef!</p> <p>Chef is a powerful automation platform that transforms infrastructure into code. Whether you’re operating in the cloud, on-premises, or in a hybrid environment, Chef automates how infrastructure is configured, deployed, and managed across your network, no matter its size.</p> <p>This diagram shows how you develop, test, and deploy your Chef code.</p> <img src="https://docs.chef.io/release/11-18/_images/start_chef.svg" width="700px">   <h2 id="chef-components">Chef Components</h2> <p>The following diagram shows the relationships between the various elements of Chef, including the nodes, the server, and the workstations. These elements work together to provide the chef-client the information and instruction that it needs so that it can do its job. As you are reviewing the rest of this doc, use the icons in the tables to refer back to this image.</p> <img alt="_images/overview_chef_11-16.png" src="https://docs.chef.io/release/11-18/_images/overview_chef_11-16.png"> <p>Chef comprises three main elements: a server, one (or more) nodes, and at least one workstation.</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>The Chef server acts as a hub that is available to every node in the organization. This ensures that the right cookbooks (and recipes) are available, that the right policies are being applied, that the node object used during the previous chef-client run is available to the current chef-client run, and that all of the nodes that will be maintained by the chef-client are registered and known to the Chef server.</li> <li>The workstation is the location from which cookbooks (and recipes) are authored, cookbooks (and recipes) are tested, policy data (such as roles, environments, and data bags) are defined, data is synchronized with the chef-repo, and data is uploaded to the Chef server.</li> <li>Each node contains a chef-client that performs the various infrastructure automation tasks that are required, including pulling configuration data from the Chef server as it is required during the chef-client run.</li> </ul> <p>The following sections discuss these elements (and their various components) in more detail.</p>   <h2 id="nodes">Nodes</h2> <p>A node is any machine—physical, virtual, cloud, network device, etc.—that is under management by Chef.</p> <p>The types of nodes that can be managed by Chef include, but are not limited to, the following:</p> <table class="docutils"> <colgroup> <col width="19%"> <col width="81%"> </colgroup> <thead valign="bottom"> <tr class="row-odd">

The Chef server stores cookbooks, the policies that are applied to nodes, and metadata that describes each registered node that is being managed by the chef-client. Nodes use the chef-client to ask the Chef server for configuration details, such as recipes, templates, and file distributions. The chef-client then does as much of the configuration work as possible on the nodes themselves (and not on the Chef server).

When a recipe is run against a system, but nothing has changed on either the system or in the recipe, the chef-client won’t change anything.</p> <p class="last">The Recipe DSL is a Ruby DSL that is primarily used to declare resources from within a recipe. The Recipe DSL also helps ensure that recipes interact with nodes (and node properties) in the desired manner. Most of the methods in the Recipe DSL are used to find a specific parameter and then tell the chef-client what action(s) to take, based on whether that parameter is present on a node.</p> </td> </tr> <tr class="row-even">

<p class="first">A resource is a statement of configuration policy that:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Describes the desired state for a configuration item</li> <li>Declares the steps needed to bring that item to the desired state</li> <li>Specifies a resource type—such as <code class="docutils literal">package</code>, <code class="docutils literal">template</code>, or <code class="docutils literal">service</code>
</li> <li>Lists additional details (also known as resource properties), as necessary</li> <li>Are grouped into recipes, which describe working configurations</li> </ul> <p>Where a resource represents a piece of the system (and its desired state), a provider defines the steps that are needed to bring that piece of the system from its current state into the desired state.</p> <p class="last">Chef has <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.chef.io/resources.html" target="_blank">many built-in resources</a> that cover all of the most common actions across all of the most common platforms. You can <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.chef.io/lwrp.html" target="_blank">build your own resources</a> for handle any situation that isn’t covered by a built-in resource.</p> </td> </tr> <tr class="row-odd">

Templates may contain Ruby expressions and statements, and are a great way to manage configuration files. Use the <strong>template</strong> resource to add cookbook templates to recipes; place the corresponding Embedded Ruby (ERB) template file in a cookbook’s <code class="docutils literal">/templates</code> directory.</td> </tr> <tr class="row-even">

<img src="https://docs.chef.io/release/11-18/_images/icon_cookbook_tests.svg" width="100px">  </td> <td>Testing cookbooks improves the quality of those cookbooks by ensuring they are doing what they are supposed to do and that they are authored in a consistent manner. Unit and integration testing validates the recipes in cookbooks. Syntax testing—often called linting—validates the quality of the code itself. The following tools are popular tools used for testing Chef recipes: Kitchen, ChefSpec, and Foodcritic.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Chef is a thin DSL (domain-specific language) built on top of Ruby. This approach allows Chef to provide just enough abstraction to make reasoning about your infrastructure easy. Chef includes a built-in taxonomy of all the basic resources one might configure on a system, plus a defined mechanism to extend that taxonomy using the full power of the Ruby language. Ruby was chosen because it provides the flexibility to use both the simple built-in taxonomy, as well as being able to handle any customization path your organization requires.</p>
