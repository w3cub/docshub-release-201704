   <h2 id="become">Become</h2> <p>Ansible allows you to ‘become’ another user, different from the user that logged into the machine (remote user). This is done using existing privilege escalation tools, which you probably already use or have configured, like <code>sudo</code>, <code>su</code>, <code>pfexec</code>, <code>doas</code>, <code>pbrun</code>, <code>dzdo</code>, <code>ksu</code> and others.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p> <p class="last">Before 1.9 Ansible mostly allowed the use of <code>sudo</code> and a limited use of <code>su</code> to allow a login/remote user to become a different user and execute tasks, create resources with the 2nd user’s permissions. As of 1.9 <code>become</code> supersedes the old sudo/su, while still being backwards compatible. This new system also makes it easier to add other privilege escalation tools like <code>pbrun</code> (Powerbroker), <code>pfexec</code>, <code>dzdo</code> (Centrify), and others.</p> </div> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p> <p class="last">Become vars &amp; directives are independent, i.e. setting <code>become_user</code> does not set <code>become</code>.</p> </div>  <h3 id="directives">Directives</h3> <p>These can be set from play to task level, but are overriden by connection variables as they can be host specific.</p> <dl class="docutils"> <dt>become</dt> <dd>set to ‘true’/’yes’ to activate privilege escalation.</dd> <dt>become_user</dt> <dd>set to user with desired privileges — the user you ‘become’, NOT the user you login as. Does NOT imply <code>become: yes</code>, to allow it to be set at host level.</dd> <dt>become_method</dt> <dd>(at play or task level) overrides the default method set in ansible.cfg, set to <code>sudo</code>/<code>su</code>/<code>pbrun</code>/<code>pfexec</code>/<code>doas</code>/<code>dzdo</code>/<code>ksu</code>
</dd> <dt>become_flags</dt> <dd>(at play or task level) permit to use specific flags for the tasks or role. One common use is to change user to nobody when the shell is set to no login. Added in Ansible 2.2.</dd> </dl> <p>For example, to manage a system service (which requires <code>root</code> privileges) when connected as a non-<code>root</code> user (this takes advantage of the fact that the default value of <code>become_user</code> is <code>root</code>):</p> <pre data-language="yaml">- name: Ensure the httpd service is running
  service:
    name: httpd
    state: started
  become: true
</pre> <p>To run a command as the <code>apache</code> user:</p> <pre data-language="yaml">- name: Run a command as the apache user
  command: somecommand
  become: true
  become_user: apache
</pre> <p>To do something as the <code>nobody</code> user when the shell is nologin:</p> <pre data-language="yaml">- name: Run a command as nobody
  command: somecommand
  become: true
  become_method: su
  become_user: nobody
  become_flags: '-s /bin/sh'
</pre>   <h3 id="connection-variables">Connection variables</h3> <p>Each allows you to set an option per group and/or host, these are normally defined in inventory but can be used as normal variables.</p> <dl class="docutils"> <dt>ansible_become</dt> <dd>equivalent of the become directive, decides if privilege escalation is used or not.</dd> <dt>ansible_become_method</dt> <dd>allows to set privilege escalation method</dd> <dt>ansible_become_user</dt> <dd>allows to set the user you become through privilege escalation, does not imply <code>ansible_become: True</code>
</dd> <dt>ansible_become_pass</dt> <dd>allows you to set the privilege escalation password</dd> </dl> <p>For example, if you want to run all tasks as <code>root</code> on a server named <code>webserver</code>, but you can only connect as the <code>manager</code> user, you could use an inventory entry like this:</p> <pre data-language="yaml">webserver ansible_user=manager ansible_become=true

It is recommended to move to become as they may be retired at one point. You cannot mix directives on the same object (become and sudo) though, Ansible will complain if you try to.</p> <p>Become will default to using the old sudo/su configs and variables if they exist, but will override them if you specify any of the new ones.</p>   <h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3> <p>Although privilege escalation is mostly intuitive, there are a few limitations on how it works. Users should be aware of these to avoid surprises.</p>  <h4 id="becoming-an-unprivileged-user">Becoming an Unprivileged User</h4> <p>Ansible 2.0.x and below has a limitation with regards to becoming an unprivileged user that can be a security risk if users are not aware of it. Ansible modules are executed on the remote machine by first substituting the parameters into the module file, then copying the file to the remote machine, and finally executing it there.</p> <p>Everything is fine if the module file is executed without using <code>become</code>, when the <code>become_user</code> is root, or when the connection to the remote machine is made as root. In these cases the module file is created with permissions that only allow reading by the user and root.</p> <p>The problem occurs when the <code>become_user</code> is an unprivileged user. Ansible 2.0.x and below make the module file world readable in this case, as the module file is written as the user that Ansible connects as, but the file needs to be readable by the user Ansible is set to <code>become</code>.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p> <p class="last">In Ansible 2.1, this window is further narrowed: If the connection is made as a privileged user (root), then Ansible 2.1 and above will use chown to set the file’s owner to the unprivileged user being switched to. This means both the user making the connection and the user being switched to via <code>become</code> must be unprivileged in order to trigger this problem.</p> </div> <p>If any of the parameters passed to the module are sensitive in nature, then those pieces of data are located in a world readable module file for the duration of the Ansible module execution. Once the module is done executing, Ansible will delete the temporary file. If you trust the client machines then there’s no problem here. If you do not trust the client machines then this is a potential danger.</p> <p>Ways to resolve this include:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Use <a class="reference internal" href="../intro_configuration/#pipelining"><span class="std std-ref">pipelining</span></a>. When pipelining is enabled, Ansible doesn’t save the module to a temporary file on the client. Instead it pipes the module to the remote python interpreter’s stdin. Pipelining does not work for non-python modules.</li> <li>(Available in Ansible 2.1) Install POSIX.1e filesystem acl support on the managed host. If the temporary directory on the remote host is mounted with POSIX acls enabled and the <strong class="command">setfacl</strong> tool is in the remote <code>PATH</code> then Ansible will use POSIX acls to share the module file with the second unprivileged user instead of having to make the file readable by everyone.</li> <li>Don’t perform an action on the remote machine by becoming an unprivileged user. Temporary files are protected by UNIX file permissions when you <code>become</code> root or do not use <code>become</code>. In Ansible 2.1 and above, UNIX file permissions are also secure if you make the connection to the managed machine as root and then use <code>become</code> to an unprivileged account.</li> </ul> <div class="versionchanged"> <p><span class="versionmodified">Changed in version 2.1.</span></p> </div> <p>In addition to the additional means of doing this securely, Ansible 2.1 also makes it harder to unknowingly do this insecurely. Whereas in Ansible 2.0.x and below, Ansible will silently allow the insecure behaviour if it was unable to find another way to share the files with the unprivileged user, in Ansible 2.1 and above Ansible defaults to issuing an error if it can’t do this securely. If you can’t make any of the changes above to resolve the problem, and you decide that the machine you’re running on is secure enough for the modules you want to run there to be world readable, you can turn on <code>allow_world_readable_tmpfiles</code> in the <code>ansible.cfg</code> file. Setting <code>allow_world_readable_tmpfiles</code> will change this from an error into a warning and allow the task to run as it did prior to 2.1.</p>   <h4 id="connection-plugin-support">Connection Plugin Support</h4> <p>Privilege escalation methods must also be supported by the connection plugin used. Most connection plugins will warn if they do not support become. Some will just ignore it as they always run as root (jail, chroot, etc).</p>   <h4 id="only-one-method-may-be-enabled-per-host">Only one method may be enabled per host</h4> <p>Methods cannot be chained. You cannot use <code>sudo /bin/su -</code> to become a user, you need to have privileges to run the command as that user in sudo or be able to su directly to it (the same for pbrun, pfexec or other supported methods).</p>   <h4 id="can-t-limit-escalation-to-certain-commands">Can’t limit escalation to certain commands</h4> <p>Privilege escalation permissions have to be general. Ansible does not always use a specific command to do something but runs modules (code) from a temporary file name which changes every time. If you have ‘/sbin/service’ or ‘/bin/chmod’ as the allowed commands this will fail with ansible as those paths won’t match with the temporary file that ansible creates to run the module.</p> <div class="admonition seealso"> <p class="first admonition-title">See also</p> <dl class="last docutils"> <dt><a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/ansible-project" target="_blank">Mailing List</a></dt> <dd>Questions?
