<h1>Redirections</h1> <p class="summary">URL redirection, or URL forwarding, is a technique to keep links alive while the actual resource, being a page, a form or a whole Web application, is located at a different URL. HTTP provides a special kind of responses, <em><strong>HTTP redirects</strong></em>, to perform this operation used for numerous goals: temporary redirection while site maintenance is ongoing, permanent redirection to keep external links working after a change of the site's architecture, progress pages when uploading a file, and many more …</p> <h2 id="Principle">Principle</h2> <p>In HTTP, a redirection is triggered by the server by sending special responses to a request: <em>redirects</em>. HTTP redirects are responses with a status code of <code>3xx</code>. A browser, when receiving a redirect response, uses the new URL provided and immediately loads it: most of the time, the redirection is transparent to the user, besides a small performance hit.</p> <p><img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13785/HTTPRedirect.png" alt=""></p> <p>They are several types of redirects and they fall in three categories: permanent, temporary and special redirections.</p> <h3 id="Permanent_redirections">Permanent redirections</h3> <p>These redirections are meant to last forever. They imply that the original URL should not be used anymore and that the new one is preferred. Search engine robots trigger an update of the associated URL for the resource in their indexes.</p> <table class="standard-table"> <thead> <tr> <th scope="col">Code</th> <th scope="col">Text</th> <th scope="col">Method handling</th> <th scope="col">Typical use case</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><code>301</code></td> <td><code>Moved Permanently</code></td> <td>

In this case a temporary redirect can be used. Search engine robots don't memorize the new, temporary link. Temporary redirections are also used when creating, updating and deleting resources to present temporary progress pages.</p> <table class="standard-table"> <thead> <tr> <th scope="col">Code</th> <th scope="col">Text</th> <th scope="col">Method handling</th> <th scope="col">Typical use case</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><code>302</code></td> <td><code>Found</code></td> <td>

The <a href="../status/304/" title="The HTTP 304 Not Modified client redirection response code indicates that there is no need to retransmit the requested resources. It is an implicit redirection to a cached resource. This happens when the request method is safe, like a GET or a HEAD request, or when the request is conditional and uses a If-None-Match or a If-Modified-Since header."><code>304</code></a> (Not Modified) redirects a page to the locally cached copy (that was stale), and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/300" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" target="_blank"><code>300</code></a> (Multiple Choice) is a manual redirection: the body, presented by the browser as a Web page, lists the possible redirections and the user clicks on one to select it.</p> <table class="standard-table"> <thead> <tr> <th scope="col">Code</th> <th scope="col">Text</th> <th scope="col">Typical use case</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><code>300</code></td> <td><code>Multiple Choice</code></td> <td>Not many: the choices are listed in an HTML page in the body. Could be served with a <a href="../status/200/" title="The HTTP 200 OK success status response code indicates that the request has succeeded. A 200 response is cacheable by default."><code>200</code></a> <code>OK</code> status.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>304</code></td> <td><code>Not Modified</code></td> <td>Cache refresh: this indicates that the cache value is still fresh an can be used.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2 id="Alternative_way_of_specifying_redirections">Alternative way of specifying redirections</h2> <p>HTTP redirects aren't the only way to defining redirections. There are two other methods: HTML redirections using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta" title="The HTML &lt;meta&gt; element represents any metadata information that cannot be represented by one of the other HTML meta-related elements (&lt;base&gt;, &lt;link&gt;, &lt;script&gt;, &lt;style&gt; or &lt;title&gt;)." target="_blank"><code>&lt;meta&gt;</code></a> element, and JavaScript redirections using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model" target="_blank">DOM</a>.</p> <h3 id="HTML_redirections">HTML redirections</h3> <p>HTTP redirects aren't the preferred way to create redirections, but sometimes the Web developer doesn't have the control over the server or cannot configure it. For these specific cases, the Web developers can craft an HTML page with a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta" title="The HTML &lt;meta&gt; element represents any metadata information that cannot be represented by one of the other HTML meta-related elements (&lt;base&gt;, &lt;link&gt;, &lt;script&gt;, &lt;style&gt; or &lt;title&gt;)." target="_blank"><code>&lt;meta&gt;</code></a> element and the <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#attr-http-equiv" target="_blank">http-equiv</a></code> attribute set to <code>refresh</code> in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head" title="The HTML &lt;head&gt; element provides general information (metadata) about the document, including its title and links to its scripts and style sheets." target="_blank"><code>&lt;head&gt;</code></a> of the page. When displaying the page, the browser will find this element and will go to the indicated page.</p> <pre data-language="html">&lt;head&gt; 
  &lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;URL='http://www.example.com/'" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
</pre> <p>The <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes#attr-content" target="_blank">content</a></code> attribute starts with a number indicating how many seconds the browser should wait before redirecting to the given URL. Always set it to <code>0</code>, for better accessibility.</p> <p>Obviously, this method only works with HTML pages (or similar) and cannot be used for images or any other type of content.</p> <div class="note"> <p>Note that these redirections break the back button in browser: you can go back to a page with this header but it instantaneously moves forward again.</p> </div> <h3 id="JavaScript_redirections">JavaScript redirections</h3> <p>Redirections in JavaScript are created by setting a value to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/location" title="The Window.location read-only property returns a Location object with information about the current location of the document." target="_blank"><code>window.location</code></a> property and the new page is loaded.</p> <pre data-language="js">window.location = "http://www.example.com/";</pre> <p>Like HTML redirections, this can't work on all resources, and obviously this will only work on clients that execute JavaScript. On the other side, there are more possibilities as you can trigger the redirection only if some conditions are met, for example.</p> <h3 id="Order_of_precedence">Order of precedence</h3> <p>With three possibilities for URL redirections, several methods can be specified at the same time, but which one is applied first? The order of precedence is the following:</p> <ol> <li>HTTP redirects are always executed first when there is not even a page transmitted, and of course not even read.</li> <li>HTML redirects (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta" title="The HTML &lt;meta&gt; element represents any metadata information that cannot be represented by one of the other HTML meta-related elements (&lt;base&gt;, &lt;link&gt;, &lt;script&gt;, &lt;style&gt; or &lt;title&gt;)." target="_blank"><code>&lt;meta&gt;</code></a>) are executed if there weren't any HTTP redirects.</li> <li>JavaScript redirects are used as the last resort, and only if JavaScript is enabled on the client side.</li> </ol> <p>When possible, always try to use HTTP redirects, and don't use a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta" title="The HTML &lt;meta&gt; element represents any metadata information that cannot be represented by one of the other HTML meta-related elements (&lt;base&gt;, &lt;link&gt;, &lt;script&gt;, &lt;style&gt; or &lt;title&gt;)." target="_blank"><code>&lt;meta&gt;</code></a> element. If a developer changes the HTTP redirects and forgets the HTML redirects, redirects are no more identical, or end up in an infinite loop, or other nightmares happen.</p> <h2 id="Use_cases">Use cases</h2> <p>There are numerous use cases for redirects, but as performance is impacted with every redirect, their use should be kept at a minimum.</p> <h3 id="Domain_aliasing">Domain aliasing</h3> <p>Ideally, there is one location, and therefore one URL, for one resource. But there are reasons for wanting to have alternative names for a resource (several domains, like with and without the www prefix or shorter and easy to remember URLs, …). In these cases, rather than duplicating the resource, it is useful to use a redirect to the one true (canonical) URL.</p> <p>Domain aliasing can be done for several reasons:</p> <ul> <li>Expanding the reach of your site. A common case is when your site resides under the <code>www.example.com</code> domain and accessing your pages from <code>example.com</code> should be possible, too. Redirections for <code>example.com</code> pages to <code>www.example.com</code> are set up in this case. You might also provide commonly used synonym names, or frequent typos of your domain names.</li> <li>Moving to a different domain. For example, your company has been renamed and you when searching for the old name, you want people used to the old company Web site still find you under the new name.</li> <li>Forcing HTTPS. Request to the HTTP version of your site will be redirected to the HTTPS version of your site.</li> </ul> <h3 id="Keeping_links_alive">Keeping links alive</h3> <p>When you restructure Web sites, URLs of resources change. Even if you can update the internal links of your Web site to match the new naming scheme, you have no control over the URLs used by external resources. You don't want to break this link as they bring you valuable users (and help your SEO), so you set up redirects from the old URLs to the new ones.</p> <div class="note"> <p>Even if this technique also works for internal links, you should try to avoid having internal redirects. A redirect has a significant performance cost (as an extra HTTP request is done) and if you can avoid it by correcting internal links, you should fix these links.</p> </div> <h3 id="Temporary_responses_to_unsafe_requests">Temporary responses to unsafe requests</h3> <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/safe" class="glossaryLink" title="Unsafe: An HTTP method is safe if it doesn't alter the state of the server. In other words, a method is safe if it leads to a read-only operation. Several common HTTP methods are safe: GET, HEAD, or OPTIONS. All safe methods are also idempotent as well as some, but not all, unsafe methods like PUT, or DELETE." target="_blank">Unsafe</a> requests modify the state of the server and the user shouldn't to replay them inadvertently. Typically, you don't want your users to resent <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" target="_blank"><code>PUT</code></a>, <a href="../methods/post/" title="The HTTP POST method sends data to the server. The type of the body of the request is indicated by the Content-Type header."><code>POST</code></a> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/DELETE" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" target="_blank"><code>DELETE</code></a> requests. If you just serve the response as the result of this request, a simple press of the reload button will (possibly after a confirmation message), resend the request.</p> <p>In this case, the server can send back a <a href="../status/303/" title="The HTTP 303 See Other redirect status response code, usually sent back as a result of a PUT or POST operation, indicates that the redirects don't link to the newly uploaded resources but to another page, like a confirmation page or an upload progress page. The method used to display this redirected page is always GET."><code>303</code></a> (See Other) request that will contain the right information, but if the reload button is pressed, only this page is redisplayed, without replaying the unsafe requests.</p> <h3 id="Temporary_responses_for_long_requests">Temporary responses for long requests</h3> <p>Some requests may need more time on the server, like sometimes <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/DELETE" title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" target="_blank"><code>DELETE</code></a> requests that are scheduled for later processing. In this of case, the response is a <a href="../status/303/" title="The HTTP 303 See Other redirect status response code, usually sent back as a result of a PUT or POST operation, indicates that the redirects don't link to the newly uploaded resources but to another page, like a confirmation page or an upload progress page. The method used to display this redirected page is always GET."><code>303</code></a> (See Other) redirect that links to a page indicating that the action has been scheduled, and eventually informs about the progress, or allows to cancel it.</p> <h2 id="Configuring_redirects_in_common_servers">Configuring redirects in common servers</h2> <h3 id="Apache">Apache</h3> <p>Redirects can be set either in the server config file, either in the <code>.htaccess</code> of each directory.</p> <p>The <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_alias.html" target="_blank">mod_alias</a> module has <code>Redirect</code> and <code>Redirect_Match</code> directives that set up a <a href="../status/302/" title="The HTTP 302 Found redirect status response code indicates that the resource requested has been temporarily moved to the URL given by the Location headers. A browser redirects to this page, but search engines don't update their links to the resource (In SEO-speak, it is said that the link-juice is not sent to the new URL)."><code>302</code></a> response (by default):</p> <pre>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
	ServerName example.com
	Redirect / http://www.example.com
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre> <p>The URL <code>http://example.com/</code> will be redirected to <code>http://www.example.com/</code> (but not <code>http://example.com/other.html</code> )</p> <p><code>Redirect_Match</code> does the same but takes a regular expression to define a collection of URLs that are affected:</p> <pre>RedirectMatch ^/images/(.*)$ http://images.example.com/$1</pre> <p>All documents in the <code>images/</code> folder will be redirected to a different domain.</p> <p>If you don't want to set up a temporary redirect, an extra parameter (either the HTTP status code to use or the <code>permanent</code> keyword can be used to set up a different redirect:</p> <pre>Redirect permanent / http://www.example.com
Redirect 301 / http://www.example.com
</pre> <p>The <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html" target="_blank">mod_rewrite</a> module can also be used to create redirects. It is more flexible, but a bit more complex to use.</p> <h3 id="Nginx">Nginx</h3> <p>In Nginx, you create a specific server block for the content you want to redirect:</p> <pre>server {
	listen 80;
	server_name example.com;
	return 301 $scheme://www.example.com$request_uri;
}</pre> <p>For having a redirect applying to a folder or a subset of the pages only, use the <code>rewrite</code> directive:</p> <pre>rewrite ^/images/(.*)$ http://images.example.com/$1 redirect;
rewrite ^/images/(.*)$ http://images.example.com/$1 permanent;
</pre> <h3 id="IIS">IIS</h3> <p>In IIS, you use the <code><a href="https://www.iis.net/configreference/system.webserver/httpredirect" target="_blank">&lt;httpRedirect&gt;</a></code> element to configure redirections.</p> <h2 id="Redirection_loops">Redirection loops</h2> <p>Redirection loops happen when successive redirections follow the one that has already been followed. In other words, there is a loop that will never be finished and no page will be found ultimately.</p> <p>Most of the time this is a server problem and if the server cannot detect it, it will send back a <a href="../status/500/" title="The HTTP 500 Internal Server Error server error response code indicates that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request."><code>500</code></a> <code>Internal Server Error</code>. If you encounter such an error soon after modifying a server configuration, this is likely a redirection loop.</p> <p>Sometimes, the server won't detect it: a redirection loop can spread over several servers which each don't have the full picture. In this case, browsers will detect it and post an error message. Firefox will display:</p> <pre id="comment_text_0" class="bz_comment_text">Firefox has detected that the server is redirecting the request for this address in a way that will never complete.</pre> <p>while Chrome will display:</p> <pre>This Webpage has a redirect loop</pre> <p>In both cases, the user can't do much (unless a corruption is happening on their side, like a mismatch of cache or cookies).</p> <p>It is important to avoid redirection loops as they completely break the user experience.</p>
