<h1>Status</h1> <p>HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific <a href="../">HTTP</a> request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes: informational responses, successful responses, redirects, client errors, and servers errors.</p> <h2 id="Information_responses">Information responses</h2> <dl> <dt><a title="The HTTP 100 Continue informational status response code indicates that everything so far is OK and that the client should continue with the request or ignore it if it is already finished." href="../status/100/"><code>100 Continue</code></a></dt> <dd>This interim response indicates that everything so far is OK and that the client should continue with the request or ignore it if it is already finished.</dd> <dt><a title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/101" target="_blank"><code>101 Switching Protocol</code></a></dt> <dd>This code is sent in response to an <code>Upgrade:</code> request header by the client, and indicates that the protocol the server is switching too. It was introduced to allow migration to an incompatible protocol version, and is not in common use.</dd> </dl> <h2 id="Successful_responses">Successful responses</h2> <dl> <dt><a title="The HTTP 200 OK success status response code indicates that the request has succeeded. A 200 response is cacheable by default." href="../status/200/"><code>200 OK</code></a></dt> <dd>The request has succeeded. The meaning of a success varies depending on the HTTP method:<br> GET: The resource has been fetched and is transmitted in the message body.<br> HEAD: The entity headers are in the message body.<br> POST: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body.<br> TRACE: The message body contains the request message as received by the server</dd> <dt><a title="The HTTP 201 Created success status response code indicates that the request has succeeded and has led to the creation of a resource. The new resource is effectively created before this response is sent back. and the new resource is returned in the body of the message, its location being either the URL of the request, or the content of the Location header." href="../status/201/"><code>201 Created</code></a></dt> <dd>The request has succeeded and a new resource has been created as a result of it. This is typically the response sent after a PUT request.</dd> <dt><a title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/202" target="_blank"><code>202 Accepted</code></a></dt> <dd>The request has been received but not yet acted upon. It is non-committal, meaning that there is no way in HTTP to later send an asynchronous response indicating the outcome of processing the request. It is intended for cases where another process or server handles the request, or for batch processing.</dd> <dt><a title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/203" target="_blank"><code>203 Non-Authoritative Information</code></a></dt> <dd>This response code means returned meta-information set is not exact set as available from the origin server, but collected from a local or a third party copy. Except this condition, 200 OK response should be preferred instead of this response.</dd> <dt><a title="The HTTP 204 No Content success status response code indicates that the request has succeed, but that the client doesn't need to go away from its current page. A 204 response is cacheable by default. An ETag header is included in such a response." href="../status/204/"><code>204 No Content</code></a></dt> <dd>There is no content to send for this request, but the headers may be useful. The user-agent may update its cached headers for this resource with the new ones.</dd> <dt><a title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/205" target="_blank"><code>205 Reset Content</code></a></dt> <dd>This response code is sent after accomplishing request to tell user agent reset document view which sent this request.</dd> <dt><a title="The HTTP 206 Partial Content success status response code indicates that the request has succeeded and has the body contains the requested ranges of data, as described in the Range header of the request." href="../status/206/"><code>206 Partial Content</code></a></dt> <dd>This response code is used because of range header sent by the client to separate download into multiple streams.</dd> </dl> <h2 id="Redirection_messages">Redirection messages</h2> <dl> <dt><a title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/300" target="_blank"><code>300 Multiple Choice</code></a></dt> <dd>The request has more than one possible responses. User-agent or user should choose one of them. There is no standardized way to choose one of the responses.</dd> <dt><a title="The HTTP 301 Moved Permanently redirect status response code indicates that the resource requested has been definitively moved to the URL given by the Location headers. A browser redirects to this page, and search engines update their links to the resource (In SEO-speak, it is said that the link-juice is sent to the new URL)." href="../status/301/"><code>301 Moved Permanently</code></a></dt> <dd>This response code means that URI of requested resource has been changed. Probably, new URI would be given in the response.</dd> <dt><a title="The HTTP 302 Found redirect status response code indicates that the resource requested has been temporarily moved to the URL given by the Location headers. A browser redirects to this page, but search engines don't update their links to the resource (In SEO-speak, it is said that the link-juice is not sent to the new URL)." href="../status/302/"><code>302 Found</code></a></dt> <dd>This response code means that URI of requested resource has been changed <em>temporarily</em>. New changes in the URI might be made in the future. Therefore, this same URI should be used by the client in future requests.</dd> <dt><a title="The HTTP 303 See Other redirect status response code, usually sent back as a result of a PUT or POST operation, indicates that the redirects don't link to the newly uploaded resources but to another page, like a confirmation page or an upload progress page. The method used to display this redirected page is always GET." href="../status/303/"><code>303 See Other</code></a></dt> <dd>Server sent this response to directing client to get requested resource to another URI with an GET request.</dd> <dt><a title="The HTTP 304 Not Modified client redirection response code indicates that there is no need to retransmit the requested resources. It is an implicit redirection to a cached resource. This happens when the request method is safe, like a GET or a HEAD request, or when the request is conditional and uses a If-None-Match or a If-Modified-Since header." href="../status/304/"><code>304 Not Modified</code></a></dt> <dd>This is used for caching purposes. It is telling to client that response has not been modified. So, client can continue to use same cached version of response.</dd> <dt><a title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/305" target="_blank"><code>305 Use Proxy</code></a></dt> <dd>This means requested response must be accessed by a proxy. This response code is not largely supported because security reasons.</dd> <dt><a title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/306" target="_blank"><code>306 unused</code></a></dt> <dd>This response code is no longer used, it is just reserved currently. It was used in a previous version of the HTTP 1.1 specification.</dd> <dt><a title='The method and the body of the original request are reused to perform the redirected request. In the cases where you want the method used to be changed to GET, use 303 See Also instead. This is useful when you want to give an answer to a PUT method that is not the uploaded resources, but a confirmation message (like "You successfully uploaded XYZ").' href="../status/307/"><code>307 Temporary Redirect</code></a></dt> <dd>Server sent this response to directing client to get requested resource to another URI with same method that used prior request. This has the same semantic than the <code>302 Found</code> HTTP response code, with the exception that the user agent <em>must not</em> change the HTTP method used: if a <code>POST</code> was used in the first request, a <code>POST</code> must be used in the second request.</dd> <dt><a title="The request method and the body will not be altered, whereas 301 may incorrectly sometimes be changed to a GET method." href="../status/308/"><code>308 Permanent Redirect</code></a></dt> <dd>This means that the resource is now permanently located at another URI, specified by the <code>Location:</code> HTTP Response header. This has the same semantics as the <code>301 Moved Permanently</code> HTTP response code, with the exception that the user agent <em>must not</em> change the HTTP method used: if a <code>POST</code> was used in the first request, a <code>POST</code> must be used in the second request.</dd> </dl> <h2 id="Client_error_responses">Client error responses</h2> <dl> <dt><a title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/400" target="_blank"><code>400 Bad Request</code></a></dt> <dd>This response means that server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.</dd> <dt><a title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/401" target="_blank"><code>401 Unauthorized</code></a></dt> <dd>Authentication is needed to get requested response.

This response code probably is most famous one due to its frequency to occur in the web. These are often called broken or dead links and lead to link rot." href="../status/404/"><code>404 Not Found</code></a></dt> <dd>Server can not find requested resource. This response code probably is most famous one due to its frequency to occur in web.</dd> <dt><a title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/405" target="_blank"><code>405 Method Not Allowed</code></a></dt> <dd>The request method is known by the server but has been disabled and cannot be used. The two mandatory methods, <code>GET</code> and <code>HEAD</code>, must never be disabled and should not return this error code.</dd> <dt><a title="The HTTP 406 Not Acceptable client error response code indicates that a response matching the list of acceptable values defined in Accept-Charset and Accept-Language cannot be served." href="../status/406/"><code>406 Not Acceptable</code></a></dt> <dd>This response is sent when the web server, after performing <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP/Content_negotiation#Server-driven_negotiation" target="_blank">server-driven content negotiation</a>, doesn't find any content following the criteria given by the user agent.</dd> <dt><a title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/407" target="_blank"><code>407 Proxy Authentication Required</code></a></dt> <dd>This is similar to 401 but authentication is needed to be done by a proxy.</dd> <dt><a title="The documentation about this has not yet been written; please consider contributing!" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/408" target="_blank"><code>408 Request Timeout</code></a></dt> <dd>This response is sent on an idle connection by some servers, even without any previous request by the client. It means that the server would like to shut down this unused connection.
