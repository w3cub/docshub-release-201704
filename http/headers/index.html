<h1>Headers</h1> <p>HTTP headers allow the client and the server to pass additional information with the request or the response. A request header consists of its case-insensitive name followed by a colon '<code>:</code>', then by its value (without line breaks). Leading white space before the value is ignored.</p> <p>Custom proprietary headers can be added using the 'X-' prefix, but this convention was deprecated in June 2012, because of the inconveniences it caused when non-standard fields became standard in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6648" target="_blank">RFC 6648</a>; others are listed in an <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/perm-headers.html" class="external" target="_blank">IANA registry</a>, whose original content was defined in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4229" class="external" target="_blank">RFC 4229</a>. IANA also maintains a <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/prov-headers.html" class="external" target="_blank">registry of proposed new HTTP message headers</a>.</p> <p>Headers can be grouped according to their contexts:</p> <ul> <li>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/General_header" class="glossaryLink" title="General header: A general header is an HTTP header that can be used for both, request and response messages, but don't apply to the content itself. Depending on the context they are used in, general headers are either response or request headers. However, they are not entity headers." target="_blank">General header</a>: Headers applying to both requests and responses but with no relation to the data eventually transmitted in the body.</li> <li>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Request_header" class="glossaryLink" title="Request header: A request header is an HTTP header that can be used in an HTTP request, and that doesn't relate to the content of the message. Request headers, like Accept, Accept-*, or If-* allow to perform conditional requests; others like Cookie, User-Agent or Referer precise the context so that the server can tailor the answer." target="_blank">Request header</a>: Headers containing more information about the resource to be fetched or about the client itself.</li> <li>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header" class="glossaryLink" title="Response header: A response header is an HTTP header that can be used in an HTTP response and that doesn't relate to the content of the message. Response headers, like Age, Location or Server are used to give a more detailed context of the response." target="_blank">Response header</a>: Headers with additional information about the response, like its location or about the server itself (name and version etc.).</li> <li>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Entity_header" class="glossaryLink" title="Entity header: An entity header is an HTTP header describing the content of the body of the message. Entity headers are used in both, HTTP requests and responses. Headers like Content-Length, Content-Language, Content-Encoding are entity headers." target="_blank">Entity header</a>: Headers containing more information about the body of the entity, like its content length or its MIME-type.</li> </ul> <p>Headers can also be grouped according to how proxies handle them:</p> <dl> <dt>
End-to-end headers</dt> <dd>These headers must be transmitted to the final recipient of the message; that is, the server for a request or the client for a response. Intermediate proxies must retransmit end-to-end headers unmodified and caches must store them.</dd> <dt>
Hop-by-hop headers</dt> <dd>These headers are meaningful only for a single transport-level connection and must not be retransmitted by proxies or cached. Such headers are: <a href="../headers/connection/" title="The Connection general header controls whether or not the network connection stays open after the current transaction finishes.
