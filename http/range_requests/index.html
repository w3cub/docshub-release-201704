<h1>Range requests</h1> <p class="summary">HTTP range requests allow to send only a portion of an HTTP message from a server to a client. Partial requests are useful for large media or downloading files with pause and resume functions, for example.</p> <h2 id="Checking_if_a_server_supports_partial_requests">Checking if a server supports partial requests</h2> <p>If the <a title="The Accept-Ranges response HTTP header is a marker used by the server to advertise its support of partial requests. The value of this field indicates the unit that can be used to define a range." href="../headers/accept-ranges/"><code>Accept-Ranges</code></a> is present in HTTP responses (and its value isn't "<code>none</code>"), the server supports range requests. You can check this by issuing a <a title="The HTTP HEAD method requests the headers that are returned if the specified resource would be requested with an HTTP GET method. Such a request can be done before deciding to download a large resource to save bandwidth, for example." href="../methods/head/"><code>HEAD</code></a> request and cURL, for example.</p> <pre>curl -I http://i.imgur.com/z4d4kWk.jpg

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 146515
</pre> <p>In this response, <code>Accept-Ranges: bytes</code> indicates that bytes can be used as unit to define a range. Here the <a title="The Content-Length entity header is indicating the size of the entity-body, in decimal number of octets, sent to the recipient." href="../headers/content-length/"><code>Content-Length</code></a> header is also useful as it indicates the full size of the image to retrieve.</p> <p>If sites omit the <code>Accept-Ranges</code> header, they likely don't support for partial requests. Some sites also explicitly send "<code>none</code>" as a value, indicating no support. In some apps, download managers disable their pause buttons in that case.</p> <pre>curl -I https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwTZ2xpQwpA

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
Accept-Ranges: none
</pre> <h2 id="Requesting_a_specific_range_from_a_server">Requesting a specific range from a server</h2> <p>If the server supports range requests, you can issue such a request by using the <a title="The Range HTTP request header indicates the part of a document that the server should return. Several parts can be requested with one Range header at once, and the server may send back these ranges in a multipart document. If the server sends back ranges, it uses the 206 Partial Content for the response. If the ranges are invalid, the server returns the 416 Range Not Satisfiable error. The server can also ignore the Range header and return the whole document with a 200 status code." href="../headers/range/"><code>Range</code></a> header. It indicates the part(s) of a document that the server should return.</p> <h3 id="Single_part_ranges">Single part ranges</h3> <p>We can request a single range from a resource. Again, we can test a request by using cURL. The "<code>-H</code>" option will append a header line to the request, which in this case is the <code>Range</code> header requesting the first 1024 bytes.</p> <pre>curl http://i.imgur.com/z4d4kWk.jpg -i -H "Range: bytes=0-1023"</pre> <p>The issued request looks like this:</p> <pre>GET /z4d4kWk.jpg HTTP/1.1
Host: i.imgur.com
Range: bytes=0-1023</pre> <p>The server responses with the <a title="The HTTP 206 Partial Content success status response code indicates that the request has succeeded and has the body contains the requested ranges of data, as described in the Range header of the request." href="../status/206/"><code>206</code></a> <code>Partial Content</code> status:</p> <pre>HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content

(binary content)
</pre> <p>The <a title="The Content-Length entity header is indicating the size of the entity-body, in decimal number of octets, sent to the recipient." href="../headers/content-length/"><code>Content-Length</code></a> header now indicates the size of the requested range (and not the full size of the image). The <a title="The Content-Range response HTTP header indicates where in a full body message a partial message belongs." href="../headers/content-range/"><code>Content-Range</code></a> response header indicates where in the full resource this partial message belongs.</p> <h3 id="Multipart_ranges">Multipart ranges</h3> <p>The <a title="The Range HTTP request header indicates the part of a document that the server should return. Several parts can be requested with one Range header at once, and the server may send back these ranges in a multipart document. If the server sends back ranges, it uses the 206 Partial Content for the response. If the ranges are invalid, the server returns the 416 Range Not Satisfiable error. The server can also ignore the Range header and return the whole document with a 200 status code." href="../headers/range/"><code>Range</code></a> header also allows you to get multiple ranges at once in a multipart document. The ranges are separated by a comma.</p> <pre>curl http://www.example.com -i -H "Range: bytes=0-50, 100-150"</pre> <p>The server responses with the <a title="The HTTP 206 Partial Content success status response code indicates that the request has succeeded and has the body contains the requested ranges of data, as described in the Range header of the request." href="../status/206/"><code>206</code></a> <code>Partial Content</code> status and a <a title="The Content-Type entity header is used to indicate the media type of the resource." href="../headers/content-type/"><code>Content-Type</code></a><code>: multipart/byteranges; boundary=3d6b6a416f9b5</code> header, indicating that a multipart byterange follows. Each part contains its own <code>Content-Type</code> and <code>Content-Range</code> fields and the required boundary parameter specifies the boundary string used to separate each body-part.</p> <pre>HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content

This header can be used either with a <a title="The Last-Modified response HTTP header contains the date and time at which the origin server believes the resource was last modified.

It allows caches to be more efficient, and saves bandwidth, as a web server does not need to send a full response if the content has not changed.

The servers sends data to the client straight away without buffering the response or determining the exact length, which leads to improved latency. Range requests and chunking are compatible and can be used with or without each other.</p> <h2 id="See_also">See also</h2> <ul> <li>Related status codes <a title="The HTTP 200 OK success status response code indicates that the request has succeeded.
