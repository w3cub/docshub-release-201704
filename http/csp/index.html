<h1>CSP</h1> <p class="summary"><strong>Content Security Policy</strong> (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSP" class="glossaryLink" title="CSP: A CSP (Content Security Policy) is used to detect and mitigate certain types of website related attacks like XSS and data injections." target="_blank">CSP</a>) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/XSS" class="glossaryLink" title="XSS: Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a security exploit which allows an attacker to inject malicious client-side code into a website, which is then executed by the victims. The intent is to allow a person to bypass access controls and impersonate users. According to the Open Web Application Security Project, XSS is the third most common vulnerability in web applications for 2013." target="_blank">XSS</a>) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware.</p> <p>CSP is designed to be fully backward compatible (except CSP version 2 where there are some explicitly-mentioned inconsistencies in backward compatibility; more details <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2" target="_blank">here</a> section 1.1). Browsers that don't support it still work with servers that implement it, and vice-versa: browsers that don't support CSP simply ignore it, functioning as usual, defaulting to the standard same-origin policy for web content. If the site doesn't offer the CSP header, browsers likewise use the standard <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy" title="En/Same origin policy for JavaScript" target="_blank">same-origin policy</a>.</p> <p>To enable CSP, you need to configure your web server to return the <a href="../headers/content-security-policy/" title="The HTTP Content-Security-Policy response header allows web site administrators to control resources the user agent is allowed to load for a given page. With a few exceptions, policies mostly involve specifying server origins and script endpoints. This helps guard against cross-site scripting attacks (XSS)."><code>Content-Security-Policy</code></a> HTTP header (sometimes you will see mentions of the <code>X-Content-Security-Policy</code> header, but that's an older version and you don't need to specify it anymore).</p> <p>Alternatively, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta" title="The HTML &lt;meta&gt; element represents any metadata information that cannot be represented by one of the other HTML meta-related elements (&lt;base&gt;, &lt;link&gt;, &lt;script&gt;, &lt;style&gt; or &lt;title&gt;)." target="_blank"><code>&lt;meta&gt;</code></a> element can be used to configure a policy, for example: <code>&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'; image-src https:*; child-src 'none';"&gt;</code></p> <h2 id="Threats">Threats</h2> <h3 id="Mitigating_cross_site_scripting">Mitigating cross site scripting</h3> <p>A primary goal of CSP is to mitigate and report XSS attacks. XSS attacks exploit the browser's trust of the content received from the server. Malicious scripts are executed by the victim's browser because the browser trusts the source of the content, even when it's not coming from where it seems to be coming from.</p> <p>CSP makes it possible for server administrators to reduce or eliminate the vectors by which XSS can occur by specifying the domains that the browser should consider to be valid sources of executable scripts. A CSP compatible browser will then only execute scripts loaded in source files received from those whitelisted domains, ignoring all other script (including inline scripts and event-handling HTML attributes).</p> <p>As an ultimate form of protection, sites that want to never allow scripts to be executed can opt to globally disallow script execution.</p> <h3 id="Mitigating_packet_sniffing_attacks">Mitigating packet sniffing attacks</h3> <p>In addition to restricting the domains from which content can be loaded, the server can specify which protocols are allowed to be used; for example (and ideally, from a security standpoint), a server can specify that all content must be loaded using HTTPS. A complete data transmission security strategy includes not only enforcing HTTPS for data transfer, but also marking all <a href="../cookies/">cookies with the secure flag</a> and providing automatic redirects from HTTP pages to their HTTPS counterparts. Sites may also use the <a href="../headers/strict-transport-security/" title="The HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (often abbreviated as HSTS) is a security feature that lets a web site tell browsers that it should only be communicated with using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP."><code>Strict-Transport-Security</code></a> HTTP header to ensure that browsers connect to them only over an encrypted channel<strong>.</strong></p> <h2 id="Using_CSP">Using CSP</h2> <p>Configuring Content Security Policy involves adding the <a href="../headers/content-security-policy/" title="The HTTP Content-Security-Policy response header allows web site administrators to control resources the user agent is allowed to load for a given page. With a few exceptions, policies mostly involve specifying server origins and script endpoints. This helps guard against cross-site scripting attacks (XSS)."><code>Content-Security-Policy</code></a> HTTP header to a web page and giving it values to control resources the user agent is allowed to load for that page. For example, a page that uploads and displays images could allow images from anywhere, but restrict a form action to a specific endpoint. A properly designed Content Security Policy helps protect a page against a cross site scripting attack. This article explains how to construct such headers properly, and provides examples.</p> <h3 id="Specifying_your_policy">Specifying your policy</h3> <p>You can use the <a href="../headers/content-security-policy/" title="The HTTP Content-Security-Policy response header allows web site administrators to control resources the user agent is allowed to load for a given page.

The policy specified in <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> headers is enforced while the <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code> policy generates reports but is not enforced.</p> <p>Browsers that support CSP always send a violation report for each attempt to violate the policy you have established if the policy contains a valid <a href="../headers/content-security-policy/report-uri/" title="The HTTP Content-Security-Policy (CSP) report-uri directive instructs the user agent to report attempts to violate the Content Security Policy.

It uses the following policy, disallowing everything but stylesheets from <code>cdn.example.com</code>.</div> <div> <pre class="syntaxbox">Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; style-src cdn.example.com; report-uri /_/csp-reports</pre> </div> <div>The HTML of <code>signup.html</code> looks like this:</div> <pre data-language="html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Sign Up&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    ... Content ...
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre> <div>Can you spot the mistake? Stylesheets are only allowed to be loaded from <code>cdn.example.com</code>, yet the website tries to load one from its own origin (<code>http://example.com</code>). A browser capable of enforcing CSP will send the following violation report as a POST request to <code><a href="http://example.com/_/csp-reports" rel="freelink" target="_blank">http://example.com/_/csp-reports</a></code>, when the document is visited:</div> <pre>{
  "csp-report": {
    "document-uri": "http://example.com/signup.html",
    "referrer": "",
    "blocked-uri": "http://example.com/css/style.css",
    "violated-directive": "style-src cdn.example.com",
    "original-policy": "default-src 'none'; style-src cdn.example.com; report-uri /_/csp-reports"
  }
}</pre> <p>As you can see, the report includes the full path to the violating resource in <code>blocked-uri</code>. This is not always the case. For example, when the <code>signup.html</code> would attempt to load CSS from <a href="http://anothercdn.example.com/stylesheet.css" target="_blank"><code>http://anothercdn.example.com/stylesheet.css</code></a>, the browser would <em>not</em> include the full path but only the origin (<code>http://anothercdn.example.com</code>). The CSP specification <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#violation-reports" target="_blank">gives an explanation</a> of this odd behaviour. In summary, this is done to prevent leaking sensitive information about cross-origin resources. Note, that even the specification got this part wrong in its <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#sample-violation-report" target="_blank">example on violation reports</a> (<code>blocked-uri</code> should be "<code>http://evil.example.com</code>").</p> <h2 id="Browser_compatibility">Browser compatibility</h2>  <div id="compat-desktop"><table class="compat-table"> <thead> <tr> <th>Feature</th> <th>Chrome</th> <th>Edge</th> <th>Firefox</th> <th>Internet Explorer</th> <th>Opera</th> <th>Safari</th> <th>Servo</th> </tr> </thead>
