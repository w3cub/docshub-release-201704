<h1 id="environmental-variables">Environmental Variables</h1> <p>Vagrant has a set of environmental variables that can be used to configure and control it in a global way. This page lists those environmental variables.</p> <h2 id="vagrant_debug_launcher"><code>VAGRANT_DEBUG_LAUNCHER</code></h2> <p>For performance reasons, especially for Windows users, Vagrant uses a static binary to launch the actual Vagrant process. If you have <em>very</em> early issues when launching Vagrant from the official installer, you can specify the <code>VAGRANT_DEBUG_LAUNCHER</code> environment variable to output debugging information about the launch process.</p> <h2 id="vagrant_default_provider"><code>VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER</code></h2> <p>This configures the default provider Vagrant will use.</p> <p>This normally does not need to be set since Vagrant is fairly intelligent about how to detect the default provider. By setting this, you will force Vagrant to use this provider for any <em>new</em> Vagrant environments. Existing Vagrant environments will continue to use the provider they came <code>up</code> with. Once you <code>vagrant destroy</code> existing environments, this will take effect.</p> <h2 id="vagrant_box_update_check_disable"><code>VAGRANT_BOX_UPDATE_CHECK_DISABLE</code></h2> <p>By default, Vagrant will query the metadata API server to see if a newer box version is available for download. This optional can be disabled on a per-Vagrantfile basis with <code>config.vm.box_check_update</code>, but it can also be disabled globally setting <code>VAGRANT_BOX_UPDATE_CHECK_DISABLE</code> to any non-empty value.</p> <p>This option will not affect global box functions like <code>vagrant box update</code>.</p> <h2 id="vagrant_checkpoint_disable"><code>VAGRANT_CHECKPOINT_DISABLE</code></h2> <p>Vagrant does occasional network calls to check whether the version of Vagrant that is running locally is up to date. We understand that software making remote calls over the internet for any reason can be undesirable. To surpress these calls, set the environment variable <code>VAGRANT_CHECKPOINT_DISABLE</code> to any non-empty value.</p> <p>If you use other HashiCorp tools like Packer and would prefer to configure this setting only once, you can set <code>CHECKPOINT_DISABLE</code> instead.</p> <h2 id="vagrant_cwd"><code>VAGRANT_CWD</code></h2> <p><code>VAGRANT_CWD</code> can be set to change the working directory of Vagrant. By default, Vagrant uses the current directory you are in. The working directory is important because it is where Vagrant looks for the Vagrantfile. It also defines how relative paths in the Vagrantfile are expanded, since they're expanded relative to where the Vagrantfile is found.</p> <p>This environmental variable is most commonly set when running Vagrant from a scripting environment in order to set the directory that Vagrant sees.</p> <h2 id="vagrant_dotfile_path"><code>VAGRANT_DOTFILE_PATH</code></h2> <p><code>VAGRANT_DOTFILE_PATH</code> can be set to change the directory where Vagrant stores VM-specific state, such as the VirtualBox VM UUID. By default, this is set to <code>.vagrant</code>. If you keep your Vagrantfile in a Dropbox folder in order to share the folder between your desktop and laptop (for example), Vagrant will overwrite the files in this directory with the details of the VM on the most recently-used host. To avoid this, you could set <code>VAGRANT_DOTFILE_PATH</code> to <code>.vagrant-laptop</code> and <code>.vagrant-desktop</code> on the respective machines. (Remember to update your <code>.gitignore</code>!)</p> <h2 id="vagrant_home"><code>VAGRANT_HOME</code></h2> <p><code>VAGRANT_HOME</code> can be set to change the directory where Vagrant stores global state. By default, this is set to <code>~/.vagrant.d</code>. The Vagrant home directory is where things such as boxes are stored, so it can actually become quite large on disk.</p> <h2 id="vagrant_log"><code>VAGRANT_LOG</code></h2> <p><code>VAGRANT_LOG</code> specifies the verbosity of log messages from Vagrant. By default, Vagrant does not actively show any log messages.</p> <p>Log messages are very useful when troubleshooting issues, reporting bugs, or getting support. At the most verbose level, Vagrant outputs basically everything it is doing.</p> <p>Available log levels are "debug," "info," "warn," and "error." Both "warn" and "error" are practically useless since there are very few cases of these, and Vagrant generally reports them within the normal output.</p> <p>"info" is a good level to start with if you are having problems, because while it is much louder than normal output, it is still very human-readable and can help identify certain issues.</p> <p>"debug" output is <em>extremely</em> verbose and can be difficult to read without some knowledge of Vagrant internals. It is the best output to attach to a support request or bug report, however.</p> <h2 id="vagrant_no_color"><code>VAGRANT_NO_COLOR</code></h2> <p>If this is set to any value, then Vagrant will not use any colorized output. This is useful if you are logging the output to a file or on a system that does not support colors.</p> <p>The equivalent behavior can be achieved by using the <code>--no-color</code> flag on a command-by-command basis. This environmental variable is useful for setting this flag globally.</p> <h2 id="vagrant_force_color"><code>VAGRANT_FORCE_COLOR</code></h2> <p>If this is set to any value, then Vagrant will force colored output, even if it detected that there is no TTY or the current environment does not support it.</p> <p>The equivalent behavior can be achieved by using the <code>--color</code> flag on a command-by-command basis. This environmental variable is useful for setting this flag globally.</p> <h2 id="vagrant_no_plugins"><code>VAGRANT_NO_PLUGINS</code></h2> <p>If this is set to any value, then Vagrant will not load any 3rd party plugins. This is useful if you install a plugin and it is introducing instability to Vagrant, or if you want a specific Vagrant environment to not load plugins.</p> <p>Note that any <code>vagrant plugin</code> commands automatically do not load any plugins, so if you do install any unstable plugins, you can always use the <code>vagrant plugin</code> commands without having to worry.</p> <h2 id="vagrant_no_parallel"><code>VAGRANT_NO_PARALLEL</code></h2> <p>If this is set, Vagrant will not perform any parallel operations (such as parallel box provisioning). All operations will be performed in serial.</p> <h2 id="vagrant_skip_subprocess_jailbreak"><code>VAGRANT_SKIP_SUBPROCESS_JAILBREAK</code></h2> <p>As of Vagrant 1.7.3, Vagrant tries to intelligently detect if it is running in the installer or running via Bundler. Although not officially supported, Vagrant tries its best to work when executed via Bundler. When Vagrant detects that you have spawned a subprocess that lives outside of Vagrant's installer, Vagrant will do its best to reset the preserved environment dring the subprocess execution.</p> <p>If Vagrant detects it is running outside of the officially installer, the original environment will always be restored. You can disable this automatic jailbreak by setting <code>VAGRANT_SKIP_SUBPROCESS_JAILBREAK</code>.</p> <h2 id="vagrant_vagrantfile"><code>VAGRANT_VAGRANTFILE</code></h2> <p>This specifies the filename of the Vagrantfile that Vagrant searches for. By default, this is "Vagrantfile." Note that this is <em>not</em> a file path, but just a filename.</p> <p>This environmental variable is commonly used in scripting environments where a single folder may contain multiple Vagrantfiles representing different configurations.</p>
