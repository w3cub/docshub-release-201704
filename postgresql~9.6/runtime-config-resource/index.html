Larger settings for <code class="VARNAME">shared_buffers</code> usually require a corresponding increase in <code class="VARNAME">max_wal_size</code>, in order to spread out the process of writing large quantities of new or changed data over a longer period of time.</p> <p>On systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage of RAM is appropriate, so as to leave adequate space for the operating system. Also, on Windows, large values for <code class="VARNAME">shared_buffers</code> aren't as effective.

The cost of setting a large value in sessions that do not actually need many temporary buffers is only a buffer descriptor, or about 64 bytes, per increment in <code class="VARNAME">temp_buffers</code>.

Setting this parameter to zero (which is the default) disables the prepared-transaction feature. This parameter can only be set at server start.</p> <p>If you are not planning to use prepared transactions, this parameter should be set to zero to prevent accidental creation of prepared transactions. If you are using prepared transactions, you will probably want <code class="VARNAME">max_prepared_transactions</code> to be at least as large as <a href="../runtime-config-connection/#GUC-MAX-CONNECTIONS">max_connections</a>, so that every session can have a prepared transaction pending.</p> <p>When running a standby server, you must set this parameter to the same or higher value than on the master server.

Note that for a complex query, several sort or hash operations might be running in parallel; each operation will be allowed to use as much memory as this value specifies before it starts to write data into temporary files. Also, several running sessions could be doing such operations concurrently. Therefore, the total memory used could be many times the value of <code class="VARNAME">work_mem</code>; it is necessary to keep this fact in mind when choosing the value. Sort operations are used for <code class="LITERAL">ORDER BY</code>, <code class="LITERAL">DISTINCT</code>, and merge joins. Hash tables are used in hash joins, hash-based aggregation, and hash-based processing of <code class="LITERAL">IN</code> subqueries.</p> </dd> <dt id="GUC-MAINTENANCE-WORK-MEM">

It defaults to 64 megabytes (<code class="LITERAL">64MB</code>). Since only one of these operations can be executed at a time by a database session, and an installation normally doesn't have many of them running concurrently, it's safe to set this value significantly larger than <code class="VARNAME">work_mem</code>. Larger settings might improve performance for vacuuming and for restoring database dumps.</p> <p>Note that when autovacuum runs, up to <a href="../runtime-config-autovacuum/#GUC-AUTOVACUUM-MAX-WORKERS"> autovacuum_max_workers</a> times this memory may be allocated, so be careful not to set the default value too high.

<code class="VARNAME">replacement_sort_tuples</code> (<code class="TYPE">integer</code>)</dt> <dd> <p>When the number of tuples to be sorted is smaller than this number, a sort will produce its first output run using replacement selection rather than quicksort. This may be useful in memory-constrained environments where tuples that are input into larger sort operations have a strong physical-to-logical correlation. Note that this does not include input tuples with an <span class="emphasis EMPHASIS c2">inverse</span> correlation. It is possible for the replacement selection algorithm to generate one long run that requires no merging, where use of the default strategy would result in many runs that must be merged to produce a final sorted output. This may allow sort operations to complete sooner.</p> <p>The default is 150,000 tuples. Note that higher values are typically not much more effective, and may be counter-productive, since the priority queue is sensitive to the size of available CPU cache, whereas the default strategy sorts runs using a <i class="FIRSTTERM">cache oblivious</i> algorithm. This property allows the default sort strategy to automatically and transparently make effective use of available CPU cache.</p> <p>Setting <code class="VARNAME">maintenance_work_mem</code> to its default value usually prevents utility command external sorts (e.g., sorts used by <code class="COMMAND">CREATE INDEX</code> to build B-Tree indexes) from ever using replacement selection sort, unless the input tuples are quite wide.</p> </dd> <dt id="GUC-AUTOVACUUM-WORK-MEM">

<code class="VARNAME">max_stack_depth</code> (<code class="TYPE">integer</code>)</dt> <dd> <p>Specifies the maximum safe depth of the server's execution stack. The ideal setting for this parameter is the actual stack size limit enforced by the kernel (as set by <code class="LITERAL">ulimit -s</code> or local equivalent), less a safety margin of a megabyte or so. The safety margin is needed because the stack depth is not checked in every routine in the server, but only in key potentially-recursive routines such as expression evaluation. The default setting is two megabytes (<code class="LITERAL">2MB</code>), which is conservatively small and unlikely to risk crashes. However, it might be too small to allow execution of complex functions. Only superusers can change this setting.</p> <p>Setting <code class="VARNAME">max_stack_depth</code> higher than the actual kernel limit will mean that a runaway recursive function can crash an individual backend process. On platforms where <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> can determine the kernel limit, the server will not allow this variable to be set to an unsafe value.

Not all values are supported on all platforms; the first supported option is the default for that platform. The use of the <code class="LITERAL">mmap</code> option, which is not the default on any platform, is generally discouraged because the operating system may write modified pages back to disk repeatedly, increasing system I/O load; however, it may be useful for debugging, when the <code class="LITERAL">pg_dynshmem</code> directory is stored on a RAM disk, or when other shared memory facilities are not available.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> </div> <div class="SECT2"> <h2 class="SECT2" id="RUNTIME-CONFIG-RESOURCE-DISK">19.4.2.

This setting may have no effect on some platforms. The valid range is between <code class="LITERAL">0</code>, which disables forced writeback, and <code class="LITERAL">2MB</code>. The default is <code class="LITERAL">0</code>, i.e., no forced writeback. (If <code class="SYMBOL">BLCKSZ</code> is not 8kB, the maximum value scales proportionally to it.)</p> </dd> <dt id="GUC-OLD-SNAPSHOT-THRESHOLD">
<code class="VARNAME">old_snapshot_threshold</code> (<code class="TYPE">integer</code>)</dt> <dd> <p>Sets the minimum time that a snapshot can be used without risk of a <code class="LITERAL">snapshot too old</code> error occurring when using the snapshot. This parameter can only be set at server start.</p> <p>Beyond the threshold, old data may be vacuumed away. This can help prevent bloat in the face of snapshots which remain in use for a long time. To prevent incorrect results due to cleanup of data which would otherwise be visible to the snapshot, an error is generated when the snapshot is older than this threshold and the snapshot is used to read a page which has been modified since the snapshot was built.</p> <p>A value of <code class="LITERAL">-1</code> disables this feature, and is the default. Useful values for production work probably range from a small number of hours to a few days. The setting will be coerced to a granularity of minutes, and small numbers (such as <code class="LITERAL">0</code> or <code class="LITERAL">1min</code>) are only allowed because they may sometimes be useful for testing. While a setting as high as <code class="LITERAL">60d</code> is allowed, please note that in many workloads extreme bloat or transaction ID wraparound may occur in much shorter time frames.</p> <p>When this feature is enabled, freed space at the end of a relation cannot be released to the operating system, since that could remove information needed to detect the <code class="LITERAL">snapshot too old</code> condition. All space allocated to a relation remains associated with that relation for reuse only within that relation unless explicitly freed (for example, with <code class="COMMAND">VACUUM FULL</code>).</p> <p>This setting does not attempt to guarantee that an error will be generated under any particular circumstances. In fact, if the correct results can be generated from (for example) a cursor which has materialized a result set, no error will be generated even if the underlying rows in the referenced table have been vacuumed away. Some tables cannot safely be vacuumed early, and so will not be affected by this setting. Examples include system catalogs and any table which has a hash index. For such tables this setting will neither reduce bloat nor create a possibility of a <code class="LITERAL">snapshot too old</code> error on scanning.</p> </dd> </dl> </div> </div>  <div class="NAVFOOTER">  <table summary="Footer navigation table"> <tr> <td width="33%" align="left"><a href="../runtime-config-connection/" accesskey="P">Prev</a></td> <td width="34%" align="center"></td> <td width="33%" align="right"><a href="../runtime-config-wal/" accesskey="N">Next</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td width="33%" align="left">Connections and Authentication</td> <td width="34%" align="center"><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/runtime-config.html" accesskey="U" target="_blank">Up</a></td> <td width="33%" align="right">Write Ahead Log</td> </tr> </table> </div>
