<h2 id="NAME">NAME</h2> <p>perlebcdic - Considerations for running Perl on EBCDIC platforms</p> <h2 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h2> <p>An exploration of some of the issues facing Perl programmers on EBCDIC based computers. We do not cover localization, internationalization, or multi-byte character set issues other than some discussion of UTF-8 and UTF-EBCDIC.</p> <p>Portions that are still incomplete are marked with XXX.</p> <p>Perl used to work on EBCDIC machines, but there are now areas of the code where it doesn't. If you want to use Perl on an EBCDIC machine, please let us know by sending mail to perlbug@perl.org</p> <h2 id="COMMON-CHARACTER-CODE-SETS">COMMON CHARACTER CODE SETS</h2> <h3 id="ASCII">ASCII</h3> <p>The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII or US-ASCII) is a set of integers running from 0 to 127 (decimal) that imply character interpretation by the display and other systems of computers. The range 0..127 can be covered by setting the bits in a 7-bit binary digit, hence the set is sometimes referred to as "7-bit ASCII". ASCII was described by the American National Standards Institute document ANSI X3.4-1986. It was also described by ISO 646:1991 (with localization for currency symbols). The full ASCII set is given in the table below as the first 128 elements. Languages that can be written adequately with the characters in ASCII include English, Hawaiian, Indonesian, Swahili and some Native American languages.</p> <p>There are many character sets that extend the range of integers from 0..2**7-1 up to 2**8-1, or 8 bit bytes (octets if you prefer). One common one is the ISO 8859-1 character set.</p> <h3 id="ISO-8859">ISO 8859</h3> <p>The ISO 8859-$n are a collection of character code sets from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), each of which adds characters to the ASCII set that are typically found in European languages, many of which are based on the Roman, or Latin, alphabet.</p> <h3 id="Latin-1-(ISO-8859-1)">Latin 1 (ISO 8859-1)</h3> <p>A particular 8-bit extension to ASCII that includes grave and acute accented Latin characters. Languages that can employ ISO 8859-1 include all the languages covered by ASCII as well as Afrikaans, Albanian, Basque, Catalan, Danish, Faroese, Finnish, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish. Dutch is covered albeit without the ij ligature. French is covered too but without the oe ligature. German can use ISO 8859-1 but must do so without German-style quotation marks. This set is based on Western European extensions to ASCII and is commonly encountered in world wide web work. In IBM character code set identification terminology ISO 8859-1 is also known as CCSID 819 (or sometimes 0819 or even 00819).</p> <h3 id="EBCDIC">EBCDIC</h3> <p>The Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code refers to a large collection of single- and multi-byte coded character sets that are different from ASCII or ISO 8859-1 and are all slightly different from each other; they typically run on host computers. The EBCDIC encodings derive from 8-bit byte extensions of Hollerith punched card encodings. The layout on the cards was such that high bits were set for the upper and lower case alphabet characters [a-z] and [A-Z], but there were gaps within each Latin alphabet range.</p> <p>Some IBM EBCDIC character sets may be known by character code set identification numbers (CCSID numbers) or code page numbers.</p> <p>Perl can be compiled on platforms that run any of three commonly used EBCDIC character sets, listed below.</p> <h4 id="The-13-variant-characters">The 13 variant characters</h4> <p>Among IBM EBCDIC character code sets there are 13 characters that are often mapped to different integer values. Those characters are known as the 13 "variant" characters and are:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">\ [ ] { } ^ ~ ! # | $ @ `
</pre>
<p>When Perl is compiled for a platform, it looks at some of these characters to guess which EBCDIC character set the platform uses, and adapts itself accordingly to that platform. If the platform uses a character set that is not one of the three Perl knows about, Perl will either fail to compile, or mistakenly and silently choose one of the three. They are:</p> <ul> <li id="*0037*">
<b><b>0037</b></b> <p>Character code set ID 0037 is a mapping of the ASCII plus Latin-1 characters (i.e. ISO 8859-1) to an EBCDIC set. 0037 is used in North American English locales on the OS/400 operating system that runs on AS/400 computers. CCSID 0037 differs from ISO 8859-1 in 237 places, in other words they agree on only 19 code point values.</p> </li> <li id="*1047*">
<b><b>1047</b></b> <p>Character code set ID 1047 is also a mapping of the ASCII plus Latin-1 characters (i.e. ISO 8859-1) to an EBCDIC set. 1047 is used under Unix System Services for OS/390 or z/OS, and OpenEdition for VM/ESA. CCSID 1047 differs from CCSID 0037 in eight places.</p> </li> <li id="*POSIX-BC*">
<b><b>POSIX-BC</b></b> <p>The EBCDIC code page in use on Siemens' BS2000 system is distinct from 1047 and 0037. It is identified below as the POSIX-BC set.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="Unicode-code-points-versus-EBCDIC-code-points">Unicode code points versus EBCDIC code points</h3> <p>In Unicode terminology a <i>code point</i> is the number assigned to a character: for example, in EBCDIC the character "A" is usually assigned the number 193. In Unicode the character "A" is assigned the number 65. This causes a problem with the semantics of the pack/unpack "U", which are supposed to pack Unicode code points to characters and back to numbers. The problem is: which code points to use for code points less than 256? (for 256 and over there's no problem: Unicode code points are used) In EBCDIC, for the low 256 the EBCDIC code points are used. This means that the equivalences</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">pack("U", ord($character)) eq $character
unpack("U", $character) == ord $character
</pre>
<p>will hold. (If Unicode code points were applied consistently over all the possible code points, pack("U",ord("A")) would in EBCDIC equal <i>A with acute</i> or chr(101), and unpack("U", "A") would equal 65, or <i>non-breaking space</i>, not 193, or ord "A".)</p> <h3 id="Remaining-Perl-Unicode-problems-in-EBCDIC">Remaining Perl Unicode problems in EBCDIC</h3> <ul> <li> <p>Many of the remaining problems seem to be related to case-insensitive matching</p> </li> <li> <p>The extensions Unicode::Collate and Unicode::Normalized are not supported under EBCDIC, likewise for the encoding pragma.</p> </li> </ul> <h3 id="Unicode-and-UTF">Unicode and UTF</h3> <p>UTF stands for <code class="inline"><span class="w">Unicode</span> <span class="w">Transformation</span> <span class="w">Format</span></code> . UTF-8 is an encoding of Unicode into a sequence of 8-bit byte chunks, based on ASCII and Latin-1. The length of a sequence required to represent a Unicode code point depends on the ordinal number of that code point, with larger numbers requiring more bytes. UTF-EBCDIC is like UTF-8, but based on EBCDIC.</p> <p>You may see the term <code class="inline"><span class="w">invariant</span></code> character or code point. This simply means that the character has the same numeric value when encoded as when not. (Note that this is a very different concept from <a href="#The-13-variant-characters">The 13 variant characters</a> mentioned above.) For example, the ordinal value of 'A' is 193 in most EBCDIC code pages, and also is 193 when encoded in UTF-EBCDIC. All variant code points occupy at least two bytes when encoded. In UTF-8, the code points corresponding to the lowest 128 ordinal numbers (0 - 127: the ASCII characters) are invariant. In UTF-EBCDIC, there are 160 invariant characters. (If you care, the EBCDIC invariants are those characters which have ASCII equivalents, plus those that correspond to the C1 controls (80..9f on ASCII platforms).)</p> <p>A string encoded in UTF-EBCDIC may be longer (but never shorter) than one encoded in UTF-8.</p> <h3 id="Using-Encode">Using Encode</h3> <p>Starting from Perl 5.8 you can use the standard new module Encode to translate from EBCDIC to Latin-1 code points. Encode knows about more EBCDIC character sets than Perl can currently be compiled to run on.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use Encode 'from_to';

my %ebcdic = ( 176 =&gt; 'cp37', 95 =&gt; 'cp1047', 106 =&gt; 'posix-bc' );

# $a is in EBCDIC code points
from_to($a, $ebcdic{ord '^'}, 'latin1');
# $a is ISO 8859-1 code points
</pre>
<p>and from Latin-1 code points to EBCDIC code points</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use Encode 'from_to';

my %ebcdic = ( 176 =&gt; 'cp37', 95 =&gt; 'cp1047', 106 =&gt; 'posix-bc' );

# $a is ISO 8859-1 code points
from_to($a, 'latin1', $ebcdic{ord '^'});
# $a is in EBCDIC code points
</pre>
<p>For doing I/O it is suggested that you use the autotranslating features of PerlIO, see <a href="../perluniintro/">perluniintro</a>.</p> <p>Since version 5.8 Perl uses the new PerlIO I/O library. This enables you to use different encodings per IO channel. For example you may use</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use Encode;
open($f, "&gt;:encoding(ascii)", "test.ascii");
print $f "Hello World!\n";
open($f, "&gt;:encoding(cp37)", "test.ebcdic");
print $f "Hello World!\n";
open($f, "&gt;:encoding(latin1)", "test.latin1");
print $f "Hello World!\n";
open($f, "&gt;:encoding(utf8)", "test.utf8");
print $f "Hello World!\n";
</pre>
<p>to get four files containing "Hello World!\n" in ASCII, CP 0037 EBCDIC, ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) (in this example identical to ASCII since only ASCII characters were printed), and UTF-EBCDIC (in this example identical to normal EBCDIC since only characters that don't differ between EBCDIC and UTF-EBCDIC were printed). See the documentation of Encode::PerlIO for details.</p> <p>As the PerlIO layer uses raw IO (bytes) internally, all this totally ignores things like the type of your filesystem (ASCII or EBCDIC).</p> <h2 id="SINGLE-OCTET-TABLES">SINGLE OCTET TABLES</h2> <p>The following tables list the ASCII and Latin 1 ordered sets including the subsets: C0 controls (0..31), ASCII graphics (32..7e), delete (7f), C1 controls (80..9f), and Latin-1 (a.k.a. ISO 8859-1) (a0..ff). In the table names of the Latin 1 extensions to ASCII have been labelled with character names roughly corresponding to <i>The Unicode Standard, Version 6.1</i> albeit with substitutions such as s/LATIN// and s/VULGAR// in all cases, s/CAPITAL LETTER// in some cases, and s/SMALL LETTER ([A-Z])/\l$1/ in some other cases. Controls are listed using their Unicode 6.2 abbreviations. The differences between the 0037 and 1047 sets are flagged with **. The differences between the 1047 and POSIX-BC sets are flagged with ##. All ord() numbers listed are decimal. If you would rather see this table listing octal values, then run the table (that is, the pod source text of this document, since this recipe may not work with a pod2_other_format translation) through:</p> <ul> <li id="recipe-0">
<b>recipe 0</b> </li> </ul> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">perl -ne 'if(/(.{29})(\d+)\s+(\d+)\s+(\d+)\s+(\d+)/)' \
 -e '{printf("%s%-5.03o%-5.03o%-5.03o%.03o\n",$1,$2,$3,$4,$5)}' \
 perlebcdic.pod
</pre>
<p>If you want to retain the UTF-x code points then in script form you might want to write:</p> <ul> <li id="recipe-1">
<b>recipe 1</b> </li> </ul> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">open(FH,"&lt;perlebcdic.pod") or die "Could not open perlebcdic.pod: $!";
while (&lt;FH&gt;) {
    if (/(.{29})(\d+)\s+(\d+)\s+(\d+)\s+(\d+)\s+(\d+)\.?(\d*)\s+(\d+)\.?(\d*)/)
    {

            printf(
               "%s%-5.03o%-5.03o%-5.03o%-5.03o%-3o.%-5o%-3o.%.03o\n",
                                           $1,$2,$3,$4,$5,$6,$7,$8,$9);
        }
        elsif ($7 ne '') {

                                          $1,$2,$3,$4,$5,$6,$7,$8);
        }
        else {

                                               $1,$2,$3,$4,$5,$6,$8);
        }
    }
}
</pre>
<p>If you would rather see this table listing hexadecimal values then run the table through:</p> <ul> <li id="recipe-2">

<h2 id="IDENTIFYING-CHARACTER-CODE-SETS">IDENTIFYING CHARACTER CODE SETS</h2> <p>To determine the character set you are running under from perl one could use the return value of ord() or chr() to test one or more character values. For example:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$is_ascii  = "A" eq chr(65);
$is_ebcdic = "A" eq chr(193);
</pre>
<p>Also, "\t" is a <code class="inline"><span class="w">HORIZONTAL</span> <span class="w">TABULATION</span></code> character so that:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$is_ascii  = ord("\t") == 9;
$is_ebcdic = ord("\t") == 5;
</pre>
<p>To distinguish EBCDIC code pages try looking at one or more of the characters that differ between them. For example:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$is_ebcdic_37   = "\n" eq chr(37);
$is_ebcdic_1047 = "\n" eq chr(21);
</pre>
<p>Or better still choose a character that is uniquely encoded in any of the code sets, e.g.:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$is_ascii           = ord('[') == 91;
$is_ebcdic_37       = ord('[') == 186;
$is_ebcdic_1047     = ord('[') == 173;
$is_ebcdic_POSIX_BC = ord('[') == 187;
</pre>
<p>However, it would be unwise to write tests such as:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$is_ascii = "\r" ne chr(13);  #  WRONG

<p>Obviously the first of these will fail to distinguish most ASCII platforms from either a CCSID 0037, a 1047, or a POSIX-BC EBCDIC platform since "\r" eq chr(13) under all of those coded character sets. But note too that because "\n" is chr(13) and "\r" is chr(10) on the Macintosh (which is an ASCII platform) the second <code class="inline"><span class="i">$is_ascii</span></code> test will lead to trouble there.</p> <p>To determine whether or not perl was built under an EBCDIC code page you can use the Config module like so:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">use Config;

</pre>
<p>The bitwise operators such as &amp; ^ | may return different results when operating on string or character data in a perl program running on an EBCDIC platform than when run on an ASCII platform. Here is an example adapted from the one in <a href="../perlop/">perlop</a>:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl"># EBCDIC-based examples
print "j p \n" ^ " a h";                      # prints "JAPH\n"

</pre>
<p>An interesting property of the 32 C0 control characters in the ASCII table is that they can "literally" be constructed as control characters in perl, e.g. <code class="inline"><span class="s">(</span><a class="l_k" href="../functions/chr/">chr</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="n">0</span><span class="s">)</span></code> eq <code class="inline">\<span class="w">c</span><span class="i">@</span></code> )&gt; <code class="inline"><span class="s">(</span><a class="l_k" href="../functions/chr/">chr</a><span class="s">(</span><span class="n">1</span><span class="s">)</span></code> eq <code class="inline">\<span class="w">cA</span></code> )&gt;, and so on. Perl on EBCDIC platforms has been ported to take <code class="inline">\<span class="w">c</span><span class="i">@</span></code> to chr(0) and <code class="inline">\<span class="w">cA</span></code> to chr(1), etc. as well, but the characters that result depend on which code page you are using. The table below uses the standard acronyms for the controls. The POSIX-BC and 1047 sets are identical throughout this range and differ from the 0037 set at only one spot (21 decimal). Note that the <code class="inline"><span class="w">LINE</span> <span class="w">FEED</span></code> character may be generated by <code class="inline">\<span class="w">cJ</span></code> on ASCII platforms but by <code class="inline">\<span class="w">cU</span></code> on 1047 or POSIX-BC platforms and cannot be generated as a <code class="inline"><span class="q">"\c.letter."</span></code> control character on 0037 platforms. Note also that <code class="inline">\<span class="w">c</span>\</code> cannot be the final element in a string or regex, as it will absorb the terminator. But <code class="inline">\c\<i>X</i></code> is a <code class="inline"><span class="w">FILE</span>
<span class="w">SEPARATOR</span></code> concatenated with <i>X</i> for all <i>X</i>. The outlier <code class="inline">\<span class="w">c</span>?</code> on ASCII, which yields a non-C0 control <code class="inline"><span class="w">DEL</span></code> , yields the outlier control <code class="inline"><span class="w">APC</span></code> on EBCDIC, the one that isn't in the block of contiguous controls.</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">chr   ord   8859-1    0037    1047 &amp;&amp; POSIX-BC

<b>chr()</b> <p>chr() must be given an EBCDIC code number argument to yield a desired character return value on an EBCDIC platform. For example:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$CAPITAL_LETTER_A = chr(193);
</pre>
</li> <li id="ord()">
<b>ord()</b> <p>ord() will return EBCDIC code number values on an EBCDIC platform. For example:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$the_number_193 = ord("A");

<b>pack()</b> <p>The c and C templates for pack() are dependent upon character set encoding. Examples of usage on EBCDIC include:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$foo = pack("CCCC",193,194,195,196);
# $foo eq "ABCD"

</li> <li id="print()">
<b>print()</b> <p>One must be careful with scalars and strings that are passed to print that contain ASCII encodings. One common place for this to occur is in the output of the MIME type header for CGI script writing. For example, many perl programming guides recommend something similar to:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">print "Content-type:\ttext/html\015\012\015\012";
# this may be wrong on EBCDIC
</pre>
<p>Under the IBM OS/390 USS Web Server or WebSphere on z/OS for example you should instead write that as:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">print "Content-type:\ttext/html\r\n\r\n"; # OK for DGW et al
</pre>
<p>That is because the translation from EBCDIC to ASCII is done by the web server in this case (such code will not be appropriate for the Macintosh however). Consult your web server's documentation for further details.</p> </li> <li id="printf()">

<b>unpack()</b> <p>See the discussion of pack() above.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="REGULAR-EXPRESSION-DIFFERENCES">REGULAR EXPRESSION DIFFERENCES</h2> <p>As of perl 5.005_03 the letter range regular expressions such as [A-Z] and [a-z] have been especially coded to not pick up gap characters. For example, characters such as ô <code class="inline"><span class="w">o</span> <span class="w">WITH</span> <span class="w">CIRCUMFLEX</span></code> that lie between I and J would not be matched by the regular expression range <code class="inline"><span class="q">/[H-K]/</span></code> . This works in the other direction, too, if either of the range end points is explicitly numeric: <code class="inline"><span class="s">[</span>\<span class="w">x89</span>-\<span class="w">x91</span><span class="s">]</span></code> will match <code class="inline">\<span class="w">x8e</span></code> , even though <code class="inline">\<span class="w">x89</span></code> is <code class="inline"><span class="w">i</span></code> and <code class="inline">\<span class="w">x91</span> </code> is <code class="inline"><span class="w">j</span></code> , and <code class="inline">\<span class="w">x8e</span></code> is a gap character from the alphabetic viewpoint.</p> <p>If you do want to match the alphabet gap characters in a single octet regular expression try matching the hex or octal code such as <code class="inline"><span class="q">/\313/</span></code> on EBCDIC or <code class="inline"><span class="q">/\364/</span></code> on ASCII platforms to have your regular expression match <code class="inline"><span class="w">o</span> <span class="w">WITH</span> <span class="w">CIRCUMFLEX</span></code> .</p> <p>Another construct to be wary of is the inappropriate use of hex or octal constants in regular expressions. Consider the following set of subs:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">sub is_c0 {
    my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
    $char =~ /[\000-\037]/;
}

sub is_print_ascii {

    $char =~ /[\200-\237]/;
}

sub is_latin_1 {    # But not ASCII; not C1
    my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
    $char =~ /[\240-\377]/;
}
</pre>
<p>These are valid only on ASCII platforms, but can be easily rewritten to work on any platform as follows:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">sub Is_c0 {
    my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
    return $char =~ /[[:cntrl:]]/
           &amp;&amp; $char =~ /[[:ascii:]]/
           &amp;&amp; ! Is_delete($char);
}

sub Is_print_ascii {
    my $char = substr(shift,0,1);

    return $char =~ /[[:print:]]/ &amp;&amp; $char =~ /[[:ascii:]]/;

    # Alternatively:
    # return $char
    #      =~ /[ !"\#\$%&amp;'()*+,\-.\/0-9:;&lt;=&gt;?\@A-Z[\\\]^_`a-z{|}~]/;
}

sub Is_delete {
    my $char = substr(shift,0,1);
    return utf8::native_to_unicode(ord $char) == 0x7F;

           &amp;&amp; $char !~ [[:cntrl:]];
}
</pre>
<p>Another way to write <code class="inline"><span class="i">Is_latin_1</span><span class="s">(</span><span class="s">)</span></code> would be to use the characters in the range explicitly:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">sub Is_latin_1 {

</pre>
<p>Although that form may run into trouble in network transit (due to the presence of 8 bit characters) or on non ISO-Latin character sets.</p> <h2 id="SOCKETS">SOCKETS</h2> <p>Most socket programming assumes ASCII character encodings in network byte order.

Most host web servers convert EBCDIC data to ISO-8859-1 or Unicode on output.</p> <h2 id="SORTING">SORTING</h2> <p>One big difference between ASCII-based character sets and EBCDIC ones are the relative positions of upper and lower case letters and the letters compared to the digits. If sorted on an ASCII-based platform the two-letter abbreviation for a physician comes before the two letter abbreviation for drive; that is:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">@sorted = sort(qw(Dr. dr.));  # @sorted holds ('Dr.','dr.') on ASCII,
                                 # but ('dr.','Dr.') on EBCDIC
</pre>
<p>The property of lowercase before uppercase letters in EBCDIC is even carried to the Latin 1 EBCDIC pages such as 0037 and 1047. An example would be that Ë <code class="inline"><span class="w">E</span> <span class="w">WITH</span> <span class="w">DIAERESIS</span></code> (203) comes before ë <code class="inline"><span class="w">e</span> <span class="w">WITH</span> <span class="w">DIAERESIS</span></code> (235) on an ASCII platform, but the latter (83) comes before the former (115) on an EBCDIC platform. (Astute readers will note that the uppercase version of ß <code class="inline"><span class="w">SMALL</span> <span class="w">LETTER</span> <span class="w">SHARP</span> <span class="w">S</span></code> is simply "SS" and that the upper case version of ÿ <code class="inline">y WITH DIAERESIS</code> is not in the 0..255 range but it is at U+x0178 in Unicode, or <code class="inline"><span class="q">"\x{178}"</span></code> in a Unicode enabled Perl).</p> <p>The sort order will cause differences between results obtained on ASCII platforms versus EBCDIC platforms.

Do note however that such Latin-1 manipulation does not address the ÿ <code class="inline">y WITH DIAERESIS</code> character that will remain at code point 255 on ASCII platforms, but 223 on most EBCDIC platforms where it will sort to a place less than the EBCDIC numerals. With a Unicode-enabled Perl you might try:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">tr/^?/\x{178}/;

As such it would be computationally expensive.</p> <h2 id="TRANSFORMATION-FORMATS">TRANSFORMATION FORMATS</h2> <p>There are a variety of ways of transforming data with an intra character set mapping that serve a variety of purposes. Sorting was discussed in the previous section and a few of the other more popular mapping techniques are discussed next.</p> <h3 id="URL-decoding-and-encoding">URL decoding and encoding</h3> <p>Note that some URLs have hexadecimal ASCII code points in them in an attempt to overcome character or protocol limitation issues. For example the tilde character is not on every keyboard hence a URL of the form:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">http://www.pvhp.com/~pvhp/
</pre>
<p>may also be expressed as either of:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">http://www.pvhp.com/%7Epvhp/

http://www.pvhp.com/%7epvhp/
</pre>
<p>where 7E is the hexadecimal ASCII code point for '~'. Here is an example of decoding such a URL under CCSID 1047:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">$url = 'http://www.pvhp.com/%7Epvhp/';

<h3 id="Caesarean-ciphers">Caesarean ciphers</h3> <p>The practice of shifting an alphabet one or more characters for encipherment dates back thousands of years and was explicitly detailed by Gaius Julius Caesar in his <b>Gallic Wars</b> text. A single alphabet shift is sometimes referred to as a rotation and the shift amount is given as a number $n after the string 'rot' or "rot$n". Rot0 and rot26 would designate identity maps on the 26-letter English version of the Latin alphabet. Rot13 has the interesting property that alternate subsequent invocations are identity maps (thus rot13 is its own non-trivial inverse in the group of 26 alphabet rotations). Hence the following is a rot13 encoder and decoder that will work on ASCII and EBCDIC platforms:</p> <pre class="verbatim" data-language="perl">#!/usr/local/bin/perl

while(&lt;&gt;){
    tr/n-za-mN-ZA-M/a-zA-Z/;
