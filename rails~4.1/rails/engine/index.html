</dl> <section class="description"> <p><code>Rails::Engine</code> allows you to wrap a specific Rails application or subset of functionality and share it with other applications or within a larger packaged application. Since Rails 3.0, every <code>Rails::Application</code> is just an engine, which allows for simple feature and application sharing.</p> <p>Any <code>Rails::Engine</code> is also a <code>Rails::Railtie</code>, so the same methods (like <code>rake_tasks</code> and <code>generators</code>) and configuration options that are available in railties can also be used in engines.</p> <h2 id="class-Rails::Engine-label-Creating+an+Engine">Creating an <a href="../engine/">Engine</a>
</h2> <p>In Rails versions prior to 3.0, your gems automatically behaved as engines, however, this coupled Rails to Rubygems. Since Rails 3.0, if you want a gem to automatically behave as an engine, you have to specify an <code>Engine</code> for it somewhere inside your plugin's <code>lib</code> folder (similar to how we specify a <code>Railtie</code>):</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby"># lib/my_engine.rb
module MyEngine
  class Engine &lt; Rails::Engine
  end
end
</pre> <p>Then ensure that this file is loaded at the top of your <code>config/application.rb</code> (or in your <code>Gemfile</code>) and it will automatically load models, controllers and helpers inside <code>app</code>, load routes at <code>config/routes.rb</code>, load locales at <code>config/locales/*</code>, and load tasks at <code>lib/tasks/*</code>.</p> <h2 id="class-Rails::Engine-label-Configuration"><a href="../engine/configuration/">Configuration</a></h2> <p>Besides the <code>Railtie</code> configuration which is shared across the application, in a <code>Rails::Engine</code> you can access <code>autoload_paths</code>, <code>eager_load_paths</code> and <code>autoload_once_paths</code>, which, differently from a <code>Railtie</code>, are scoped to the current engine.</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby">class MyEngine &lt; Rails::Engine
  # Add a load path for this specific Engine
  config.autoload_paths &lt;&lt; File.expand_path("../lib/some/path", __FILE__)

  initializer "my_engine.add_middleware" do |app|
    app.middleware.use MyEngine::Middleware
  end
end
</pre> <h2 id="class-Rails::Engine-label-Generators"><a href="../generators/">Generators</a></h2> <p>You can set up generators for engines with <code>config.generators</code> method:</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby">class MyEngine &lt; Rails::Engine
  config.generators do |g|
    g.orm             :active_record
    g.template_engine :erb
    g.test_framework  :test_unit
  end
end
</pre> <p>You can also set generators for an application by using <code>config.app_generators</code>:</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby">class MyEngine &lt; Rails::Engine
  # note that you can also pass block to app_generators in the same way you
  # can pass it to generators method
  config.app_generators.orm :datamapper
end
</pre>  <p>Since Rails 3.0, applications and engines have more flexible path configuration (as opposed to the previous hardcoded path configuration). This means that you are not required to place your controllers at <code>app/controllers</code>, but in any place which you find convenient.</p> <p>For example, let's suppose you want to place your controllers in <code>lib/controllers</code>. You can set that as an option:</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby">class MyEngine &lt; Rails::Engine
  paths["app/controllers"] = "lib/controllers"
end
</pre> <p>You can also have your controllers loaded from both <code>app/controllers</code> and <code>lib/controllers</code>:</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby">class MyEngine &lt; Rails::Engine
  paths["app/controllers"] &lt;&lt; "lib/controllers"
end
</pre> <p>The available paths in an engine are:</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby">class MyEngine &lt; Rails::Engine
  paths["app"]                 # =&gt; ["app"]
  paths["app/controllers"]     # =&gt; ["app/controllers"]
  paths["app/helpers"]         # =&gt; ["app/helpers"]
  paths["app/models"]          # =&gt; ["app/models"]
  paths["app/views"]           # =&gt; ["app/views"]
  paths["lib"]                 # =&gt; ["lib"]
  paths["lib/tasks"]           # =&gt; ["lib/tasks"]
  paths["config"]              # =&gt; ["config"]
  paths["config/initializers"] # =&gt; ["config/initializers"]
  paths["config/locales"]      # =&gt; ["config/locales"]
  paths["config/routes.rb"]    # =&gt; ["config/routes.rb"]
end
</pre> <p>The <code>Application</code> class adds a couple more paths to this set. And as in your <code>Application</code>, all folders under <code>app</code> are automatically added to the load path. If you have an <code>app/services</code> folder for example, it will be added by default.</p> <h2 id="class-Rails::Engine-label-Endpoint">Endpoint</h2> <p>An engine can be also a rack application. It can be useful if you have a rack application that you would like to wrap with <code>Engine</code> and provide some of the <code>Engine</code>'s features.</p> <p>To do that, use the <code>endpoint</code> method:</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby">module MyEngine
  class Engine &lt; Rails::Engine
    endpoint MyRackApplication
  end
end
</pre> <p>Now you can mount your engine in application's routes just like that:</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby">Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount MyEngine::Engine =&gt; "/engine"
end
</pre> <h2 id="class-Rails::Engine-label-Middleware+stack">Middleware stack</h2> <p>As an engine can now be a rack endpoint, it can also have a middleware stack. The usage is exactly the same as in <code>Application</code>:</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby">module MyEngine
  class Engine &lt; Rails::Engine
    middleware.use SomeMiddleware
  end
end
</pre> <h2 id="class-Rails::Engine-label-Routes">Routes</h2> <p>If you don't specify an endpoint, routes will be used as the default endpoint. You can use them just like you use an application's routes:</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby"># ENGINE/config/routes.rb
MyEngine::Engine.routes.draw do
  get "/" =&gt; "posts#index"
end
</pre> <h2 id="class-Rails::Engine-label-Mount+priority">Mount priority</h2> <p>Note that now there can be more than one router in your application, and it's better to avoid passing requests through many routers. Consider this situation:</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby">Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount MyEngine::Engine =&gt; "/blog"
  get "/blog/omg" =&gt; "main#omg"
end
</pre> <p><code>MyEngine</code> is mounted at <code>/blog</code>, and <code>/blog/omg</code> points to application's controller. In such a situation, requests to <code>/blog/omg</code> will go through <code>MyEngine</code>, and if there is no such route in <code>Engine</code>'s routes, it will be dispatched to <code>main#omg</code>. It's much better to swap that:</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby">Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get "/blog/omg" =&gt; "main#omg"
  mount MyEngine::Engine =&gt; "/blog"
end
</pre> <p>Now, <code>Engine</code> will get only requests that were not handled by <code>Application</code>.</p> <h2 id="class-Rails::Engine-label-Engine+name">
<a href="../engine/">Engine</a> name</h2> <p>There are some places where an Engine's name is used:</p> <ul>
<li> <p>routes: when you mount an <a href="../engine/">Engine</a> with <code>mount(MyEngine::Engine =&gt; '/my_engine')</code>, it's used as default <code>:as</code> option</p> </li>
<li> <p>rake task for installing migrations <code>my_engine:install:migrations</code></p> </li>
</ul> <p><a href="../engine/">Engine</a> name is set by default based on class name. For <code>MyEngine::Engine</code> it will be <code>my_engine_engine</code>. You can change it manually using the <code>engine_name</code> method:</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby">module MyEngine
  class Engine &lt; Rails::Engine
    engine_name "my_engine"
  end
end
</pre> <h2 id="class-Rails::Engine-label-Isolated+Engine">Isolated <a href="../engine/">Engine</a>
</h2> <p>Normally when you create controllers, helpers and models inside an engine, they are treated as if they were created inside the application itself. This means that all helpers and named routes from the application will be available to your engine's controllers as well.</p> <p>However, sometimes you want to isolate your engine from the application, especially if your engine has its own router. To do that, you simply need to call <code>isolate_namespace</code>. This method requires you to pass a module where all your controllers, helpers and models should be nested to:</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby">module MyEngine
  class Engine &lt; Rails::Engine
    isolate_namespace MyEngine
  end
end
</pre> <p>With such an engine, everything that is inside the <code>MyEngine</code> module will be isolated from the application.</p> <p>Consider such controller:</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby">module MyEngine
  class FooController &lt; ActionController::Base
  end
end
</pre> <p>If an engine is marked as isolated, <code>FooController</code> has access only to helpers from <code>Engine</code> and <code>url_helpers</code> from <code>MyEngine::Engine.routes</code>.</p> <p>The next thing that changes in isolated engines is the behavior of routes. Normally, when you namespace your controllers, you also need to do namespace all your routes. With an isolated engine, the namespace is applied by default, so you can ignore it in routes:</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby">MyEngine::Engine.routes.draw do
  resources :articles
end
</pre> <p>The routes above will automatically point to <code>MyEngine::ArticlesController</code>. Furthermore, you don't need to use longer url helpers like <code>my_engine_articles_path</code>. Instead, you should simply use <code>articles_path</code> as you would do with your application.</p> <p>To make that behavior consistent with other parts of the framework, an isolated engine also has influence on <code>ActiveModel::Naming</code>. When you use a namespaced model, like <code>MyEngine::Article</code>, it will normally use the prefix “my_engine”. In an isolated engine, the prefix will be omitted in url helpers and form fields for convenience.</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby">polymorphic_url(MyEngine::Article.new) # =&gt; "articles_path"

form_for(MyEngine::Article.new) do
  text_field :title # =&gt; &lt;input type="text" name="article[title]" id="article_title" /&gt;
end
</pre> <p>Additionally, an isolated engine will set its name according to namespace, so MyEngine::Engine.engine_name will be “my_engine”. It will also set MyEngine.table_name_prefix to “my_engine_”, changing the MyEngine::Article model to use the my_engine_articles table.</p> <h2 id="class-Rails::Engine-label-Using+Engine-27s+routes+outside+Engine">Using Engine's routes outside <a href="../engine/">Engine</a>
</h2> <p>Since you can now mount an engine inside application's routes, you do not have direct access to <code>Engine</code>'s <code>url_helpers</code> inside <code>Application</code>. When you mount an engine in an application's routes, a special helper is created to allow you to do that. Consider such a scenario:</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby"># config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount MyEngine::Engine =&gt; "/my_engine", as: "my_engine"
  get "/foo" =&gt; "foo#index"
end
</pre> <p>Now, you can use the <code>my_engine</code> helper inside your application:</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby">class FooController &lt; ApplicationController
  def index
    my_engine.root_url # =&gt; /my_engine/
  end
end
</pre> <p>There is also a <code>main_app</code> helper that gives you access to application's routes inside Engine:</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby">module MyEngine
  class BarController
    def index
      main_app.foo_path # =&gt; /foo
    end
  end
end
</pre> <p>Note that the <code>:as</code> option given to mount takes the <code>engine_name</code> as default, so most of the time you can simply omit it.</p> <p>Finally, if you want to generate a url to an engine's route using <code>polymorphic_url</code>, you also need to pass the engine helper. Let's say that you want to create a form pointing to one of the engine's routes. All you need to do is pass the helper as the first element in array with attributes for url:</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby">form_for([my_engine, @user])
</pre> <p>This code will use <code>my_engine.user_path(@user)</code> to generate the proper route.</p> <h2 id="class-Rails::Engine-label-Isolated+engine-27s+helpers">Isolated engine's helpers</h2> <p>Sometimes you may want to isolate engine, but use helpers that are defined for it. If you want to share just a few specific helpers you can add them to application's helpers in ApplicationController:</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby">class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base
  helper MyEngine::SharedEngineHelper
end
</pre> <p>If you want to include all of the engine's helpers, you can use helper method on an engine's instance:</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby">class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base
  helper MyEngine::Engine.helpers
end
</pre> <p>It will include all of the helpers from engine's directory. Take into account that this does not include helpers defined in controllers with helper_method or other similar solutions, only helpers defined in the helpers directory will be included.</p> <h2 id="class-Rails::Engine-label-Migrations+-26+seed+data">Migrations &amp; seed data</h2> <p>Engines can have their own migrations. The default path for migrations is exactly the same as in application: <code>db/migrate</code></p> <p>To use engine's migrations in application you can use rake task, which copies them to application's dir:</p> <pre>rake ENGINE_NAME:install:migrations</pre> <p>Note that some of the migrations may be skipped if a migration with the same name already exists in application. In such a situation you must decide whether to leave that migration or rename the migration in the application and rerun copying migrations.</p> <p>If your engine has migrations, you may also want to prepare data for the database in the <code>db/seeds.rb</code> file. You can load that data using the <code>load_seed</code> method, e.g.</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby">MyEngine::Engine.load_seed
</pre> <h2 id="class-Rails::Engine-label-Loading+priority">Loading priority</h2> <p>In order to change engine's priority you can use <code>config.railties_order</code> in main application. It will affect the priority of loading views, helpers, assets and all the other files related to engine or application.</p> <pre class="ruby" data-language="ruby"># load Blog::Engine with highest priority, followed by application and other railties
config.railties_order = [Blog::Engine, :main_app, :all]
